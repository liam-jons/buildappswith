# Middleware Mock Investigation

## Version: 1.0.101

## Solution Implemented

We've resolved the "mockImplementationOnce is not a function" TypeScript error in our middleware tests by implementing a comprehensive solution using Vitest's built-in MockInstance type.

### Solution Approach

1. **Using Vitest's MockInstance Type**:
   We revised our mock implementation to use Vitest's built-in MockInstance type, which properly preserves method chaining functionality:

   ```typescript
   export const authMiddleware: MockInstance<
     [options: AuthMiddlewareOptions],
     (req: NextRequest) => Promise<NextResponse | null | undefined | void>
   > = vi.fn();
   ```

   This explicit typing tells TypeScript exactly what parameters and return type to expect, allowing it to correctly recognize methods like `mockImplementationOnce`.

2. **Helper Function for Mock Configuration**:
   We created a helper function `configureMockAuth` that encapsulates the mock configuration logic:

   ```typescript
   export function configureMockAuth<Args extends any[], Return>(
     mockFn: MockInstance<Args, Return>,
     authState: MockAuthState
   ): void {
     mockFn.mockImplementationOnce((options: any) => {
       return async (req: NextRequest) => {
         return options.afterAuth(
           authState,
           req,
           { nextUrl: req.nextUrl }
         );
       };
     });
   }
   ```

   This approach isolates the type casting complexity inside the helper function.

3. **Updated Test Pattern**:
   In test files, we replaced direct method chaining with the helper function:

   ```typescript
   const authenticatedState = createMockAuthState('user_123', false);
   configureMockAuth(authMiddleware, authenticatedState);
   ```

   This pattern is more robust and provides better type checking.

### Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was a combination of factors:

1. **TypeScript Type Definitions**: Our previous approach didn't correctly preserve the method types for Vitest mocks.
2. **Manual Module Mocking**: When using the `__mocks__` directory with TypeScript, there are specific typing patterns required.
3. **Type Casting Limitations**: Simple `as unknown as` type casting wasn't sufficient to maintain the complex mock function types.

### Complete Solution

The complete solution includes:

1. Updated `__mocks__/@clerk/nextjs.ts` with proper MockInstance typing
2. New helper function `configureMockAuth` in test utilities
3. Updated test files to use the new helper function
4. Comprehensive documentation in `docs/middleware-mock-investigation/COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION.md`

### Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Leverages Vitest's built-in types for more reliable typing
2. **Encapsulated Complexity**: Hides the type casting complexity inside helper functions
3. **Consistency**: Provides a standard pattern for all middleware test files
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and maintain as TypeScript or Vitest evolve

All middleware tests now pass without TypeScript errors.
