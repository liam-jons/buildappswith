# ADR 0026: Test Migration Approach for Clerk Authentication

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Following the migration from NextAuth.js to Clerk for authentication (ADR 0002) and the standardization of Clerk test utilities (ADR 0025), we needed to establish a systematic approach for migrating the existing test suite to use the new authentication patterns.

The challenge was to update tests across multiple types (component, API, middleware) while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring minimal disruption to the development workflow.

## Decision

We've decided to implement a phased migration approach with the following principles:

1. **Create Backward-Compatible Utilities**: Develop a new `auth-test-utils.ts` that leverages the standardized Clerk test utilities while maintaining backward compatibility with existing test patterns
  
2. **Type-First Migration**: Prioritize TypeScript in new and updated test files for better type safety and developer experience

3. **Pattern-Based Approach**: Create example implementations for each test type (component, API route, middleware) to establish consistent patterns

4. **Documentation-Driven**: Develop comprehensive documentation (`TEST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`) to guide the ongoing migration process

5. **Incremental Rollout**: Migrate tests in phases, starting with core examples of each type and expanding to the full test suite

## Approach

Our implementation approach follows these steps:

1. **Update Core Test Utilities**: Convert `auth-test-utils.js` to TypeScript and integrate with the new `clerk-test-utils.ts`

2. **Create Example Migrations**: Update one representative test file for each type (component, API route, middleware)

3. **Document Migration Patterns**: Create a detailed migration plan documenting the patterns for each test type

4. **Gradual Expansion**: Systematically migrate remaining tests following the established patterns

## Consequences

### Positive

- Tests now accurately reflect the production authentication system
- Consistent authentication testing patterns across the codebase
- Improved TypeScript typing for better developer experience
- Clear documentation for completing the migration
- Minimal disruption to development workflow during migration

### Negative

- Complete migration will require updating a significant number of test files
- Temporary inconsistency between migrated and non-migrated tests
- Learning curve for developers to adapt to new testing patterns
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during the transition
