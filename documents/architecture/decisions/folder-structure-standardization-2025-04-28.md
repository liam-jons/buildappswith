# Folder Structure Standardization

## Context

The Buildappswith codebase has grown during rapid development with inconsistent folder organization patterns. This technical debt makes navigation challenging, increases maintenance burden, and reduces developer productivity. The existing structure had several issues:

1. Mixed folder organization patterns (some by feature, some by type)
2. Inconsistent page component location
3. API structure inconsistencies
4. Scattered utility functions
5. Authentication components spread across different locations
6. Limited hook organization

## Decision

We will implement a domain-first folder structure throughout the codebase, prioritizing organization by feature over organization by type. The standardized structure follows these principles:

1. **Domain-First Organization**: Group code by domain/feature first, then by type
2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use kebab-case for directories, PascalCase for components
3. **Barrel Exports**: Use index.ts files to simplify imports
4. **Colocation**: Keep related files together when possible
5. **Clear Separation**: Maintain clear boundaries between domains
6. **Documentation**: Each major directory has a README.md explaining its purpose

The specific structure will be:

```
/components
├── [domain]/         # Domain-specific components
│   ├── ui/           # Domain-specific UI components
│   │   └── index.ts  # Barrel exports
│   └── index.ts      # Barrel exports
├── ui/               # Shared UI components
│   ├── core/         # Foundational UI components (mostly shadcn/ui)
│   ├── composite/    # Composed UI components reused across domains
│   └── index.ts      # Barrel exports
└── providers/        # Context providers
```

Similar patterns will be applied to other directories (lib, hooks, app) as well.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved maintainability through consistent organization patterns
- Reduced cognitive load when navigating the codebase
- Better component discoverability through barrel exports
- Clearer separation of concerns between domains
- Simplified imports
- Enhanced documentation

### Negative

- Short-term disruption during reorganization
- Need to update imports across the codebase
- Potential for merge conflicts in active development
- Learning curve for developers accustomed to the previous structure

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with the UI components as they are the most foundational
2. Create the directory structure and barrel exports
3. Move components to their appropriate locations
4. Update imports throughout the codebase
5. Extend the pattern to other domains
6. Document the structure in a comprehensive guide

## Progress Tracking

Initial implementation:
- Directory structure created
- Barrel exports established
- Documentation added
- First component (ValidationTierBadge) moved to new structure

Next phases:
- Move core UI components to their appropriate location
- Update imports throughout the codebase
- Apply pattern to other domains
