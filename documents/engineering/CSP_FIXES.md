# Content Security Policy Updates for Clerk and MagicUI

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing authentication-related image loading failures and CSP violations in the browser console. Missing domains in our Content Security Policy were preventing Clerk avatar images and other authentication-related resources from loading properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CSP Configuration
- Added `https://images.clerk.dev` to the img-src directive in `next.config.mjs`
- Made CSP configuration consistent between Next.js config and middleware
- Ensured all Clerk domains are properly included in relevant CSP directives

### 2. Next.js Image Configuration
- Added missing Clerk domains to remotePatterns in next.config.mjs:
  - Added `**.clerk.com` (wildcard subdomain support)
  - Added `img.clerk.com`
  - Added `images.clerk.dev`

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/architecture/MAGIC_UI_INTEGRATION.md`
- Added specific CSP requirements for MagicUI in the integration guide
- Added section for CSP configuration in Clerk documentation

## Technical Details
- File modified: `next.config.mjs`
- Implementation follows recommendations from the CSP audit in `/docs/architecture/CSP_CONFIGURATION_AUDIT.md`
- Adopted Option 1 from `/docs/engineering/CLERK_CSP_FIX.md` (direct modification of CSP in config)

## Impact
These changes resolve:
1. Missing avatar images in authentication components
2. CSP violation errors in browser console
3. Inconsistent CSP configuration between different parts of the application
4. Potential security issues from overly permissive CSP in some areas

## Testing
- Verified avatar images load correctly on login and profile pages
- Confirmed no CSP errors appear in browser console during authentication flow
- Validated integration with MagicUI components that load remote resources
