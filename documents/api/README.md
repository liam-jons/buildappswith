# Buildappswith API Documentation

*Version: 1.0.141*

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Buildappswith API. The documentation is organized by domain to provide a clear and structured reference for developers working with the platform.

## Documentation Overview

### API Overview

The [API_OVERVIEW.md](./API_OVERVIEW.md) document provides a high-level introduction to the API architecture, authentication mechanisms, and design principles. It serves as the starting point for understanding the API.

### Domain-Specific Documentation

The API documentation is organized into domain-specific directories:

- [Stripe API](./stripe/README.md): Documentation for payment processing endpoints
- [Scheduling API](./scheduling/README.md): Documentation for booking and availability management
- [Marketplace API](./marketplace/README.md): Documentation for builder discovery and profile management
- [Admin API](./admin/README.md): Documentation for administrative functions and platform management
- [Apps API](./apps/README.md): Documentation for builder application portfolio management
- [Webhooks API](./webhooks/README.md): Documentation for webhook endpoints handling external service events
- [Test API](./test/README.md): Documentation for development and testing endpoints

## API Architecture

The Buildappswith API follows a RESTful architecture organized around domain-specific resources. Each domain has its own dedicated set of endpoints with consistent patterns for resource management.

### API Request Flow

The typical flow for API requests follows this pattern:

1. Client sends a request to an endpoint
2. Authentication middleware validates the request
3. Input validation checks the request parameters
4. Business logic processes the request
5. Response is formatted and returned to the client

### Authentication and Authorization

The API uses Clerk for authentication and implements role-based authorization:

- Authentication is handled through the `withAuth` middleware
- Role-specific authorization uses `withRole`, `withAdmin`, or `withBuilder` middleware
- Most endpoints require specific roles for access

## Documentation Format

Each domain follows a consistent documentation format:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the domain's purpose and functionality
2. **Authentication**: Authentication requirements specific to the domain
3. **Endpoints**: Detailed documentation for each endpoint including:
   - URL and HTTP method
   - Request parameters and body schema
   - Response format and status codes
   - Example requests and responses
   - Error handling
4. **Common Types**: Shared data structures and types used across the domain
5. **Testing**: Guidelines for testing the endpoints
6. **Related Documentation**: Links to related documentation

## Usage Guidelines

- Use this documentation as a reference when implementing client-side interactions with the API
- Refer to the specific domain documentation for detailed information about endpoints
- Follow the authentication requirements for each endpoint
- Use the provided example requests as templates for your own implementations

## Error Handling

The API implements consistent error handling with standardized error types:

- `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR`: Authentication issues or missing token
- `AUTHORIZATION_ERROR`: Permission issues
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Input validation failure
- `RESOURCE_ERROR`: Resource not found or unavailable
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Unexpected server errors

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever:

- New API endpoints are added
- Existing endpoints are modified
- Authentication requirements change
- Response formats are updated
- Error handling is enhanced

The goal is to maintain a comprehensive and accurate reference for developers working with the Buildappswith API.
