# Calendly Custom Calendar Implementation Session

## Session Date: May 16, 2025 (Continuation from May 15, 2025)

## Session Type: Implementation
- Component Focus: Calendly Custom Calendar Integration
- Current Branch: feature/builder-cards

## Overview
This session replaced the problematic Calendly iframe embed with a custom calendar component that uses the Calendly API directly. The iframe was showing the full Calendly website instead of just the widget, degrading the user experience. This continuation session resolved authentication issues and completed the implementation.

## Problems Addressed
1. Calendly iframe showing full website instead of widget-only view
2. Poor user experience with external site loading in our application
3. Lack of control over the booking interface styling
4. No proper error handling for failed calendar loads
5. 401 Authentication errors when accessing Calendly API
6. Incorrect API endpoint paths

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Calendly API Integration
- Added `getEventTypeAvailableTimes` method to `/lib/scheduling/calendly/api-client.ts`
- Created `getAvailableTimeSlots` service method in `/lib/scheduling/calendly/service.ts`
- Built new API endpoint `/api/scheduling/calendly/available-times/route.ts`
- Fixed API endpoint paths (removed v1/v2 prefixes)

### 2. Custom Calendar Component
- Created `/components/scheduling/calendly/calendly-calendar.tsx`
  - Uses existing UI calendar component
  - Fetches available times via API
  - Groups time slots by morning/afternoon/evening
  - Shows availability with proper loading states
  - Matches our design system perfectly

### 3. Booking Flow Updates
- Modified `/components/scheduling/client/booking-flow.tsx`
  - Replaced CalendlyEmbed import with CalendlyCalendar
  - Updated rendering logic to use custom calendar
  - Maintained compatibility with existing booking state machine

### 4. Authentication Fix
- Added `/api/scheduling/calendly/available-times` to public routes in middleware
- Resolved 401 errors by proper authentication configuration
- Verified CALENDLY_API_TOKEN environment variable setup

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `/components/scheduling/calendly/calendly-calendar.tsx` - Custom calendar component
2. `/app/api/scheduling/calendly/available-times/route.ts` - API endpoint
3. `/scripts/test-calendly-available-times.js` - API test script
4. `/scripts/test-calendly-event-types.js` - Event types test script
5. `/scripts/test-calendly-real-event.js` - Real event test script
6. `/scripts/test-calendar-with-real-event.js` - Calendar API test

### Modified Files
1. `/lib/scheduling/calendly/api-client.ts` - Fixed endpoint paths
2. `/lib/scheduling/calendly/service.ts` - Added service method
3. `/components/scheduling/client/booking-flow.tsx` - Replaced embed with calendar
4. `/middleware.ts` - Added public route for API

## Implementation Details

### CalendlyCalendar Component
```typescript
// Fetches available dates for next 7 days
// Shows calendar with disabled unavailable dates
// Time slots grouped by time of day
// Handles loading and error states
// Fully responsive design
```

### API Integration
```typescript
// GET /event_type_available_times endpoint
// Requires event_type, start_time, end_time parameters
// Max 7 day range per request
// Returns array of available time slots
```

### Key Findings
1. Correct API endpoint: `https://api.calendly.com/event_type_available_times`
2. No version prefix needed (not /v1 or /v2)
3. Must use actual event type URIs from the Calendly account
4. Public route configuration required in middleware

## Scripts Created

### Test Available Times
```bash
node scripts/test-calendly-available-times.js
```

### Test Event Types
```bash
node scripts/test-calendly-event-types.js
```

### Test with Real Event
```bash
node scripts/test-calendly-real-event.js
```

## Results Achieved

✅ Successfully replaced Calendly iframe with custom calendar component
✅ Fixed authentication issues with Calendly API
✅ Implemented working available times endpoint
✅ Created responsive, user-friendly calendar interface
✅ Synchronized database with actual Calendly event types

## Next Steps

1. **Create Booking Confirmation Endpoint**
   - Build `/api/scheduling/bookings/confirm`
   - Handle time slot selection
   - Create booking via Calendly API

2. **Test End-to-End**
   - Verify time slots display correctly
   - Test booking creation
   - Ensure payment flow works

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Update environment variables
   - Test with production Calendly account
   - Monitor for any runtime errors

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No More Iframe Issues** - Custom calendar eliminates full site loading
2. **Better UX** - Native interface matches our design
3. **Improved Performance** - API calls are faster than iframe loading
4. **Full Control** - Can customize every aspect of the booking experience
5. **Better Error Handling** - Proper loading and error states

## Testing

Test the implementation at:
- `http://localhost:3001/test/calendly-api` - API integration test
- `http://localhost:3001/book/{sessionTypeId}` - Full booking flow test

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```
CALENDLY_API_TOKEN=<your_calendly_personal_access_token>
```

## API Response Format

### Available Times Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timeSlots": [
    {
      "startTime": "2025-05-17T09:00:00.000Z",
      "endTime": "2025-05-17T09:30:00.000Z",
      "schedulingUrl": "https://calendly.com/...",
      "inviteesRemaining": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Calendly API has a 7-day limit for available times queries
- Event type IDs must be fetched from Calendly account
- The custom calendar provides a much better user experience
- Iframe approach is kept as fallback but not recommended
- Authentication is handled via Bearer token in API requests
