# Changelog v1.0.107

## Architecture Extraction Improvements

This release fixes issues with the architecture extraction process to avoid dependency on the problematic `structurizr-typescript` package.

### Changes

1. **Fixed Module Resolution Issues**
   - Created a dedicated `tsconfig.json` file for the scripts directory with Node-specific module resolution settings
   - Uses NodeNext module type and resolution to properly handle local imports
   - Added ts-node-specific configuration for improved compatibility

2. **Updated Script Configuration**
   - Modified all architecture extraction scripts to use the `--project` flag with ts-node
   - Ensured consistent module resolution across all architecture extraction scripts
   - Maintains standard TypeScript import patterns without file extensions

3. **Technical Components**
   - Improved tsconfig settings for compatibility with ts-node execution environment
   - Added transpileOnly setting to improve performance of extraction scripts
   - Used module resolution settings that match Node.js environment
   - Incremented application version from 1.0.106 to 1.0.107

### Files Changed

1. `/package.json` - Incremented version number
2. `/scripts/extract-architecture.ts` - Fixed import paths
3. `/scripts/extract-auth-architecture.ts` - Fixed import paths
4. `/scripts/run-architecture-extraction.sh` - Added --project flag
5. `/scripts/extract-auth-architecture.sh` - Added --project flag
6. `/scripts/generate-architecture-report.sh` - Added --project flag
7. `/scripts/extract-all-architecture.sh` - Added --project flag
8. `/scripts/tsconfig.json` - Created new file

### Notes

The architecture extraction process now runs without encountering module resolution errors. This allows for proper extraction and visualization of the application architecture without requiring the problematic `structurizr-typescript` package.
