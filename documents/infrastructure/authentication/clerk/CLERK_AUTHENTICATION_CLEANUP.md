# Clerk Authentication Cleanup

## Overview

This document records the completion of legacy code removal from the authentication system as part of the pre-launch preparation. The goal was to ensure a consistent, clean authentication implementation using Clerk exclusively, with no remnants of the previous NextAuth implementation.

## Completed Actions

### 1. Updated `/lib/auth/index.ts`

The file has been updated to directly export Clerk functionality:

```typescript
// Export Clerk authentication functionality
export * from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
export { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
export type { AuthObject } from '@clerk/nextjs/dist/types/server';
export * from './types';
// Export any custom helpers from clerk directory
export * from './clerk/helpers';
export * from './clerk/api-auth';
```

### 2. Updated `/lib/auth/hooks.ts`

The file has been updated to directly export Clerk hooks:

```typescript
// Direct export of Clerk hooks with type safety
export { useAuth, useUser, useClerk, useSignIn, useSignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs';
// Add any custom hooks needed
```

### 3. Added Clear Removal Warning to `/lib/auth/auth.ts`

The file has been updated with clearer warnings about its scheduled removal:

```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated THIS FILE IS SCHEDULED FOR REMOVAL IN VERSION 1.1.0
 * 
 * ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do not use this file in any new code ⚠️
 * 
 * The original NextAuth implementation has been archived in /archived/nextauth-legacy/lib/auth/auth.ts
 * 
 * Please use the Clerk authentication system instead:
 * - For client-side auth: import { useAuth, useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
 * - For server-side auth: import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
 * - For middleware: import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";
 * 
 * For protected API routes, use the helpers in /lib/auth/clerk/api-auth.ts:
 * - import { withAuth, withRole, withAdmin, withBuilder } from "@/lib/auth";
 * 
 * See documentation in /docs/engineering/CLERK_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION for more details.
 */

// This file exists only to prevent import errors during the migration period.
// It will be completely removed in version 1.1.0.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Utilities Update**: Update test utilities to properly mock Clerk authentication (tracked in a separate task).
2. **Complete Removal**: Schedule complete removal of `auth.ts` for version 1.1.0.
3. **Usage Audit**: Perform a codebase-wide audit to ensure all authentication is using the Clerk implementation consistently.
4. **Documentation Update**: Ensure all documentation reflects the current authentication approach.

## Technical Decisions

1. **Direct Export Approach**: We chose to directly export from Clerk in both `index.ts` and `hooks.ts` rather than creating a custom implementation to minimize complexity and maintain closer alignment with Clerk's documentation and future updates.
2. **Specific Removal Timeline**: We added a specific version (1.1.0) for the removal of `auth.ts` to ensure clarity on when it will be completely removed.
3. **Detailed Warning**: The warning message in `auth.ts` provides specific guidance on which alternatives to use for different authentication scenarios.

## Validation

To validate these changes:

1. **Code Review**: Ensure the changes maintain backward compatibility for imports.
2. **Linting**: Verify no linting errors are introduced.
3. **Test Execution**: Run existing tests to ensure they pass with the updated exports.
4. **Manual Testing**: Manually test authentication flows to verify they continue to work.
