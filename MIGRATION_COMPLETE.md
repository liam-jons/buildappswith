# Image to ImageUrl Migration - Completed

## Migration Summary

The migration from `image` to `imageUrl` in the User model has been successfully completed. This aligns the database schema with the application code, removing the need for runtime field mapping.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Change**
   - Created SQL migration file to rename the column
   - Applied the migration to rename `image` to `imageUrl` in the User table
   - Verified the change was successful

2. **Code Updates**
   - Updated the Prisma schema to reflect the new field name
   - Generated updated Prisma client
   - Updated `marketplace-service.ts` to use `imageUrl` directly
   - Removed the field mapper utility and imports
   - Updated logging statements

3. **Cleanup**
   - Removed the field mapper file (`user-mapper.ts`)
   - Server starts successfully with the changes

## Verification Results

- Database schema successfully updated to use `imageUrl`
- Prisma client generated without errors
- Development server starts without issues related to our changes
- Some pre-existing TypeScript errors in test files, but not related to our changes

## Benefits of This Migration

1. **Improved Performance**: Removed runtime overhead from field mapping
2. **Simplified Codebase**: Eliminated adapter patterns and complexity
3. **Better Maintainability**: Code and schema now aligned, reducing confusion
4. **Reduced Error Potential**: Removed potential source of bugs

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues in the marketplace functionality
2. **Testing**: Continue testing marketplace pages to verify image display works correctly
3. **Documentation**: Keep the migration documentation for future reference

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If issues are encountered, the rollback procedure is:

1. Execute SQL: `ALTER TABLE "User" RENAME COLUMN "imageUrl" TO "image";`
2. Restore the field mapper files and references
3. Regenerate the Prisma client
