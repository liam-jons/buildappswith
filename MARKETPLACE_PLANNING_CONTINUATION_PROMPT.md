# Marketplace Planning Continuation Prompt

## Context

We've successfully completed the Clerk Authentication and Profile Integration, which provides a solid foundation for user profiles in the Buildappswith platform. Now we need to plan the Marketplace feature, which will allow users to discover builder profiles based on various criteria.

## Current State

- User profiles are now synchronized between Clerk authentication and our database
- We have BuilderProfile and ClientProfile models in the database
- Profiles have various attributes like skills, expertise areas, and validation tiers
- We have implemented role-based access control for profile data

## Objectives for Marketplace Planning

1. Design a discoverable marketplace where clients can find qualified builders
2. Create a search and filtering system for builder profiles
3. Implement sorting and ranking algorithms for search results
4. Design the marketplace UI components and user experience
5. Plan the API endpoints needed for the marketplace
6. Ensure proper profile visibility and privacy controls
7. Include special features for ADHD-focused expertise

## Key Considerations

- Search and filtering by skills, expertise areas, and availability
- Ranking algorithms that consider validation tier, ratings, and project history
- Featured builder profiles and promoted placement options
- Advanced filtering for specific domains and technologies
- Integration with the booking system for direct session scheduling
- Analytics to track marketplace usage and conversion rates
- Privacy controls for builder information
- Admin tools for managing the marketplace

## Data to Include

- Builder skills and expertise areas
- Portfolio projects and AI apps
- Validation tier and verification status
- Ratings and testimonials
- Session types and availability
- Pricing information
- ADHD-specific expertise indicators

## Relevant Documentation

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the Marketplace requirements and existing implementations, refer to these key documents:

1. **Product Requirements Document**: `/docs/PRD/PRD3.1.md` - Contains the official marketplace requirements and user stories
2. **Existing Components**: `/components/marketplace/` - Review current marketplace components
3. **API Structure**: `/app/api/marketplace/` - Understand the existing marketplace API endpoints
4. **Profile Integration**: `/docs/engineering/CLERK_AUTH_PROFILE_INTEGRATION.md` - Reference for the auth-profile integration that powers marketplace listings
5. **Builder Profile Schema**: `/prisma/schema.prisma` (BuilderProfile model) - Current data model for builder profiles
6. **UI Components**: `/components/marketplace/ui/` - Current UI components for marketplace display

Additional context from ADHD-focused features:
- `/docs/PRD/3.0 research/buildappswith-product.txt` - Product research on ADHD-focused features
- Any existing components with `adhdFocus` properties

## Next Steps

In this session, we should:

1. Design the database schema additions needed for the marketplace
2. Create a blueprint for the search API
3. Plan the UI components for search, filtering, and results
4. Design the ranking algorithm for search results
5. Define the marketplace-specific permissions and visibility rules
6. Ensure alignment with PRD 3.1 requirements and any product improvements

Please help me plan this marketplace feature to ensure my profile (and eventually others) can be easily discovered by potential clients based on relevant expertise, particularly in ADHD-focused productivity tools. The implementation should maintain consistency with our PRD while incorporating any necessary improvements identified during development.
