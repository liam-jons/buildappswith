## I'm continuing work on the Buildappswith platform. Here's the current context:

### General Information
* Current version: 1.0.68
* Working directory: /Users/liamj/Documents/Development/buildappswith
* Production branch: main (stable, deployed to production)
* Development branch: develop (integration branch for features)
* **Branch for next session: feature/enhanced-auth-testing** (created from develop)
* Feature branch naming convention: feature/[feature-name], bugfix/[issue-name], hotfix/[issue-name]
* Development stage: Post-MVP launch with stable production deployment

### Core Documentation
* PRD 2.1 - Comprehensive platform requirements
* CI_CD_PIPELINE.md - Branch management and deployment workflow
* PROJECT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md - High-level maintenance procedures
* REQUIRED_SCRIPTS.md - Essential scripts for development and deployment
* ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT.md - Environment variable configuration
* CHANGELOG.md - Detailed version history
* TESTING_GUIDE.md - New guide for test implementation
* TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md - Comprehensive testing strategy

### Recent Progress
* Implemented basic testing framework with Jest
* Created test utilities for rendering components and testing forms
* Added test verification utilities to ensure testing infrastructure works correctly
* Established pattern for testing React components with testing-library
* Created example test cases for basic component rendering and form interaction
* Documented testing approach in TESTING_GUIDE.md and DECISIONS.md

### Technical Environment
* Frontend: Next.js 15.3.1 with App Router, React 19.1.0, TypeScript
* UI: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 with Magic UI components
* Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM v6.6.0
* Authentication: Clerk (recently migrated from NextAuth.js)
* Payment: Stripe integration
* Deployment: Vercel with GitHub integration
* Testing: Jest configured and working with basic tests

### Available MCP Tools
* File system operations (read/write/edit)
* Run command and run script
* Directory management
* GitHub repository operations
* Brave web search
* 21st UI component tools
* Logo search

### Latest Codebase Changes
* `/package.json`: Updated version to 1.0.68, added new test scripts
* `/DECISIONS.md`: Added documentation of testing framework decision
* `/CHANGELOG.md`: Updated with newest version and archived older entries to CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md
* `/__tests__/utils/test-utils-basic.js`: Created basic test utility for component rendering
* `/__tests__/unit/verify-basic-utils.test.jsx`: Added verification test for basic utilities
* `/__tests__/unit/form-utils.test.jsx`: Added test for form interactions
* `/jest.setup.js`: Updated with Clerk authentication mocks
* `/docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md`: Created new testing guide documentation

### Known Issues
* Limited test coverage for critical components
* Test utilities need enhancement for Clerk authentication testing
* No integration or E2E tests implemented yet
* Form testing utility could be enhanced for more complex interactions

## Current Focus
Task description: Implement enhanced authentication testing utilities to support testing components and routes with different user roles.

### Goals For This Session
1. Create comprehensive auth testing utilities for different user roles (client, builder, admin)
2. Implement test cases for authenticated components (e.g., BuilderProfile)
3. Add test for protected routes with role-based access control
4. Update documentation with new auth testing patterns

### Technical Requirements
* Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
* Follow Next.js 15.3.1 best practices
* Follow established naming conventions and code structure
* Update documentation with any significant changes
* Increment version number when changing code
* Ensure compatibility with Clerk authentication system

### Working Methodology
* One component focus per session
* Clearly explain existing code before modifying
* Update CHANGELOG.md with significant changes, but only AFTER I have confirmed that any changes have been reflected in the application
* Increment version number in package.json
* Report any MCP failures explicitly
* Avoid assuming traditional development constraints apply
* Recognize that we can implement complex changes in a single session
* Focus on thorough but rapid implementation approaches
* Don't let perceived technical constraints artificially slow progress

I'd appreciate your help with implementing enhanced authentication testing utilities. **IMPORTANT: Before making any changes, please review all the documentation files I've created or updated in this session, particularly TESTING_GUIDE.md and the updated DECISIONS.md.** Let's focus on achieving the goals outlined above while adhering to our project standards and building on the testing foundation we've established.
