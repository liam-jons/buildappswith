# Key Architecture and Implementation Decisions

This document tracks significant technical decisions made during the development of the Buildappswith platform.

## Authentication Migration (v1.0.65) - 2025-04-24

**Decision**: Use a clean database approach for Clerk authentication migration

**Context**: The migration from NextAuth to Clerk presented challenges with duplicate migrations trying to add the same `clerkId` field. We considered several approaches including complex migration scripts or schema merging.

**Options Considered**:
1. Traditional migration with user data preservation
2. Schema merging with manual data migration
3. Clean database approach with new user creation

**Decision**: We chose a clean database approach to simplify the migration process. This approach involves:
- Creating a direct SQL script to reset the database schema
- Bypassing Prisma migrations to avoid conflicts
- Implementing webhook handlers to create users as they authenticate

**Consequences**:
- Simplified migration process without complex data transformation
- Fresh start with clean data structures
- Users will need to re-authenticate, creating new database records
- No need for complex migration scripts or rollback procedures

**Related Decisions**:

1. **Direct SQL Schema Creation**
   - Using direct SQL commands rather than Prisma migrations
   - Bypassing migration history tracking for initial setup
   - Creating minimal schema before expanding with normal operations

2. **Dynamic Dependency Loading**
   - Using dynamic imports for svix to improve build compatibility
   - Implementing fallback mechanisms for development environments
   - Providing graceful degradation when dependencies aren't available

3. **Structured Logging System**
   - Implementing a consistent logging framework throughout the app
   - Supporting different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Integrating context information and payload data in logs

4. **Legacy Route Handling**
   - Converting legacy NextAuth routes to redirects instead of removal
   - Logging attempted access to track usage and aid debugging
   - Graceful transition for any outdated client implementations

## Authentication Migration (2025-04-24)

### Decision: Migrate from NextAuth.js to Clerk

**Context:**
The application was initially built with NextAuth.js for authentication. While functional, we encountered several limitations:
- Inconsistent authentication implementation across different parts of the application
- Limited user management capabilities
- Lack of built-in support for multi-tenant architecture
- Challenges with role-based access control for users with multiple roles

**Decision:**
Migrate to Clerk for authentication while maintaining compatibility with existing database structure.

**Approach:**
1. Add clerkId field to User model to maintain relationship between Clerk users and database users
2. Create standardized auth helpers to abstract Clerk implementation details
3. Implement combined middleware that preserves existing API protection while adding Clerk auth
4. Start with a clean database approach given no production data
5. Maintain custom role-based access control to support multi-role users

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Enhance existing NextAuth implementation - Rejected due to limitations in user management and multi-tenant features
2. Custom auth solution - Rejected due to security concerns and development time
3. Other auth providers (Auth0, Firebase) - Rejected due to less favorable developer experience and pricing models

**Consequences:**
- Improved user management through Clerk's dashboard
- Better security with Clerk's built-in features
- Foundation for multi-tenant architecture
- Cleaner auth implementation with standardized patterns
- Temporary complexity during migration period
