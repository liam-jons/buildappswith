# Key Architecture and Implementation Decisions

This document tracks significant technical decisions made during the development of the Buildappswith platform.

## Authentication Migration (2025-04-24)

### Decision: Migrate from NextAuth.js to Clerk

**Context:**
The application was initially built with NextAuth.js for authentication. While functional, we encountered several limitations:
- Inconsistent authentication implementation across different parts of the application
- Limited user management capabilities
- Lack of built-in support for multi-tenant architecture
- Challenges with role-based access control for users with multiple roles

**Decision:**
Migrate to Clerk for authentication while maintaining compatibility with existing database structure.

**Approach:**
1. Add clerkId field to User model to maintain relationship between Clerk users and database users
2. Create standardized auth helpers to abstract Clerk implementation details
3. Implement combined middleware that preserves existing API protection while adding Clerk auth
4. Start with a clean database approach given no production data
5. Maintain custom role-based access control to support multi-role users

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. Enhance existing NextAuth implementation - Rejected due to limitations in user management and multi-tenant features
2. Custom auth solution - Rejected due to security concerns and development time
3. Other auth providers (Auth0, Firebase) - Rejected due to less favorable developer experience and pricing models

**Consequences:**
- Improved user management through Clerk's dashboard
- Better security with Clerk's built-in features
- Foundation for multi-tenant architecture
- Cleaner auth implementation with standardized patterns
- Temporary complexity during migration period
