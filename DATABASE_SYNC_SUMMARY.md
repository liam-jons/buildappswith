## Session Date: 2025-05-14

## Accomplished Tasks ✅

1. **Created verification scripts**
   - `verify-database-connection.js` - Environment checker
   - `verify-production-marketplace.js` - Marketplace verification

2. **Created backup scripts**
   - `backup-production-raw.js` - Full production backup

3. **Created sync scripts**
   - `restore-dev-from-backup.js` - Restore development from JSON backup
   - `sync-schema-to-production.js` - Apply dev schema to prod
   - `copy-dev-to-prod.js` - Copy all data to production

4. **Restored development database**
   - Recovered from backup after dev was wiped
   - 27 users restored (including Liam)
   - 18 builder profiles restored

5. **Synchronized production database**
   - Backed up production data
   - Applied development schema (fixed `imageUrl` → `image`)
   - Copied all development data to production
   - Verified marketplace shows all 18 builders

6. **Created CI/CD pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated sync
   - Multiple sync options (verify, backup, sync, full)
   - Automated backup retention

7. **Created documentation**
   - Comprehensive sync documentation
   - Step-by-step procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Current State

### Development Database
- 27 users total
- 18 builder profiles
- 5 demo builders
- All searchable

### Production Database
- 27 users total (synced from dev)
- 18 builder profiles (synced from dev)
- 5 demo builders (synced from dev)
- All searchable in marketplace

## Key Files Created
- Scripts: `/scripts/` directory (6 new scripts)
- CI/CD: `.github/workflows/database-sync.yml`
- Docs: `/docs/database/DATABASE_SYNC_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## Next Steps
1. Set up GitHub Secrets for automated pipeline
2. Schedule regular sync/backup jobs
3. Monitor marketplace performance
4. Create alerts for sync failures

## Important Notes
- Production email is `liam@buildappswith.com` (NOT .ai)
- Databases are separate, not branches
- Always backup before sync
- Schema now matches between dev and prod
