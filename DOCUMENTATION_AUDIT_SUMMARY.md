# Documentation Audit Summary - April 20, 2025

## Overview

A comprehensive documentation audit was completed to align all project documentation with PRD 2.0 specifications. This audit identified discrepancies between the original vision, PRD 2.0, and the actual implementation.

## Key Actions Taken

1. **Updated Core Documentation**
   - README.md now reflects PRD 2.0 vision
   - Created MVP_COMPONENT_STATUS.md aligned with PRD 2.0
   - Documented all PRD 2.0 features in detail

2. **Documented Unplanned Features**
   - Portfolio Management
   - Builder Dashboard
   - Admin Interface
   - Stripe Payment Integration

3. **Created Deviation Documentation**
   - IMPLEMENTATION_DEVIATIONS.md explains features beyond PRD 2.0
   - Clear explanation of why additional features were built

4. **Archived Legacy Documents**
   - Moved original component status to archives
   - Preserved for reference only

## Current Status

- All PRD 2.0 features are implemented and documented
- Additional features are documented but not emphasized
- Documentation accurately reflects the codebase
- Clear distinction between MVP and future vision

## Next Steps

1. Focus marketing and support on PRD 2.0 features
2. Use additional features as value-adds, not primary offerings
3. Maintain documentation as the platform evolves
4. Update public messaging to match PRD 2.0 vision
