# Profile UI Components

This directory contains specialized UI components for the profile domain. These components are designed specifically for profile-related functionality but may be reused across different parts of the profile system.

## Component Overview

### ValidationTierBadge

The `ValidationTierBadge` component displays a visual representation of a builder's validation level within the trust architecture. It is used to communicate trust and credibility at a glance.

Features:
- Visual representation of validation tiers (Basic, Verified, Expert)
- Tooltips with validation explanations
- Color-coding for different validation levels
- Accessibility features for screen readers

Usage:
```tsx
import { ValidationTierBadge } from "@/components/profile/ui";

// In your component
<ValidationTierBadge tier="verified" size="md" />
```

### (Additional UI Components)

As more specialized profile UI components are added, they will be documented here with their purpose and usage examples.

## Design Principles

Profile UI components follow these design principles:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent visual language with the rest of the platform
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. **Responsiveness**: Design for all device sizes and orientations
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without JavaScript
5. **Performance**: Optimize for minimal bundle size and rendering performance

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing new profile UI components:

1. Use appropriate "use client" directives based on component needs
2. Include comprehensive PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
3. Document props with JSDoc comments
4. Include accessibility considerations in implementation
5. Keep components focused on a single responsibility
6. Use composition for complex UI needs
