# Trust Architecture Routes

This directory contains routes for the Buildappswith Transparent Trust Architecture, providing visualization and interaction with the platform's trust mechanisms.

## Purpose

The trust architecture routes enable users to:
- View builder validation and verification status
- Explore concrete outcomes and case studies
- Understand reliability indicators
- Access community recognition mechanisms

These routes implement the simplified trust architecture described in PRD 3.1, Section 3.1, focusing on concrete outcomes and transparent verification rather than complex multi-dimensional visualization.

## Route Structure

```
/trust
├── verification/           # Outcome verification routes
│   └── [builderId]/        # Builder-specific verification
├── validation/             # Capability validation
│   └── [builderId]/        # Builder-specific validation
├── reliability/            # Reliability indicators
│   └── [builderId]/        # Builder-specific reliability
└── recognition/            # Community recognition
    └── [builderId]/        # Builder-specific recognition
```

## Integration Points

The trust architecture routes integrate with:
- Builder profiles for displaying trust indicators
- Marketplace for filtering and discovery
- Community components for recognition mechanisms

## Implementation Notes

- All trust visualization follows the simplified model from PRD 3.1
- Focus on concrete outcomes rather than complex indicators
- Before/after metrics are emphasized for outcome verification
- Community validation plays a key role in trust building
