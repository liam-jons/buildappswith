/**
 * Final TypeScript Error Resolution Report
 * Version: 0.1.1
 */

/**
 * Summary of Final Fixes:
 * 
 * 1. Removed mock data dependencies:
 *    - Updated lib/api/builders.ts to remove references to mock data
 *    - Created placeholder implementations that can be replaced with real API calls
 * 
 * 2. Fixed type export conflicts:
 *    - Removed duplicate type exports from builder.ts
 *    - Maintained only the function exports that are used by other modules
 * 
 * 3. Next.js Generated Types:
 *    - These errors in .next/types/* are auto-generated and can be safely ignored
 *    - They don't affect runtime behavior and would be resolved with a clean build
 * 
 * 4. Build routing conflict:
 *    - Unrelated to TypeScript errors, but shows duplicate routes:
 *      - app/(platform)/admin/page.tsx
 *      - app/admin/page.tsx
 *    - One of these routes should be removed or renamed
 * 
 * To verify these fixes:
 * - Run: pnpm type-check
 * - If Next.js generated errors remain, they can be safely ignored
 * 
 * For the build error:
 * 1. Choose which admin page to keep
 * 2. Remove or rename the other admin page
 * 3. Run: pnpm build
