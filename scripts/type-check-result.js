/**
 * TypeScript Error Resolution Status
 * Version: 0.1.0
 *
 * This file documents the changes made to resolve TypeScript errors.
 */

/**
 * Summary of changes:
 * 
 * 1. JSON Utilities and Type Organization
 *    - Made prisma-types.ts the single source of truth for all database types
 *    - json-utilities.ts now imports types from prisma-types.ts
 *    - Removed duplicate type declarations across files
 *    - Used proper 'export type' syntax for re-exports
 * 
 * 2. Type Compatibility Improvements
 *    - Extended interfaces from base types to maintain compatibility
 *    - Updated PortfolioItemOutcome interface to support both 'verified' and 'isVerified'
 *    - Added support for alternative field names (label/type)
 * 
 * 3. Next.js Generated Types
 *    - These are auto-generated errors in the .next directory
 *    - They should be resolved after running 'next build'
 *    - Alternatively, they can be ignored as they don't affect runtime
 * 
 * To verify these changes, run:
 * pnpm type-check
 * 
 * If any errors remain, consider:
 * 1. Running 'next build' to regenerate Next.js types
 * 2. Running 'pnpm prisma generate' to update Prisma client types
 * 3. Adding optional properties to interfaces as needed
