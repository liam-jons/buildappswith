# Next.js Update Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing an update of Next.js from version 14.2.0 to the latest version in a safe and controlled manner.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a clean working directory (commit or stash any changes)
- Make sure you have the latest code from the main branch

## Steps for Testing Next.js Update

### 1. Create and checkout a new branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b test/next-update

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

### 2. Update Next.js and related dependencies

```bash
# Update Next.js to the latest version
pnpm add next@latest

# Update related React dependencies
pnpm add react@latest react-dom@latest
```

### 3. Check for breaking changes and fix issues

After upgrading, check for any breaking changes that might affect your application:

1. Review the Next.js upgrade guides:
   - [Upgrading from 14.x to 15.x](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-15)
   - [Next.js 14.2 release notes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-2)

2. Look for errors or warnings in the console during build or runtime.

### 4. Test the Auth0 integration

```bash
# Run the development server
pnpm run dev
```

Test the following functionality:
- Check if the "Package path ./client is not exported" error is resolved
- Verify authentication flow (login, logout)
- Test protected routes

### 5. Test the application thoroughly

- Test all major features and components
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Check performance and loading times
- Ensure all routes and pages load correctly

### 6. Document findings

Create a report of your findings, including:
- Whether the update resolved the Auth0 issues
- Any breaking changes encountered and how they were fixed
- Performance improvements or regressions
- Recommendations for proceeding with the update

### 7. Decision point

Based on your findings, decide whether to:
- Merge the update to the main branch
- Continue with more fixes before merging
- Revert to the previous version if issues are too significant

## Rollback Instructions (if needed)

If you need to revert the changes:

```bash
# Discard all changes and return to previous state
git reset --hard origin/develop

# Return to the develop branch
git checkout develop
```
