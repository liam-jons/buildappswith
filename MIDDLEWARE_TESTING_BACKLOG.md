# Middleware Testing Backlog

## Completed
- [x] Fix factory test auth mocking for protected API routes
- [x] Address status code expectations in API protection flow tests
- [x] Fix rate limiting test implementation to consistently return 429 status
- [x] Create shared authentication testing utilities for middleware tests
- [x] Implement consistent mocking patterns across all test files
- [x] Implement centralized mock approach using __mocks__ directory

## Completed (v1.0.101)
- [x] Resolve "mockImplementationOnce is not a function" errors in tests
- [x] Investigate potential TypeScript and Vitest incompatibilities with mocks
- [x] Review test setup to identify why mock methods are not being recognized
- [x] Create properly typed mock implementation using Vitest's MockInstance type
- [x] Implement configureMockAuth helper function to simplify test setup

## Completed (v1.0.114)
- [x] Migrate middleware test to use new Clerk authentication utilities
- [x] Create standardized pattern for middleware test authentication
- [x] Implement header-based test configuration for authentication states
- [x] Document middleware test migration patterns

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Migrate remaining middleware tests to new Clerk authentication utilities
- [ ] Add better instrumentation for middleware execution flow

## Low Priority
- [ ] Refactor performance tests to be more resilient to timing variations
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
- [ ] Document middleware testing patterns for future reference
