# Next.js Static Chunk Loading Error - Comprehensive Fix

## The Problem

Your Next.js application is experiencing a common but frustrating issue: 404 errors when trying to load JavaScript chunks and CSS files:

```
GET /_next/static/chunks/app/layout.js 404
GET /_next/static/chunks/app-pages-internals.js 404
GET /_next/static/chunks/main-app.js 404
GET /_next/static/css/app/layout.css 404
```

These errors occur while the API routes work correctly (`/api/marketplace/builders` returns 200 status), indicating a problem specifically with static asset serving.

## Root Causes

Based on similar issues reported in the Next.js community:

1. **Build ID Mismatch**: The server and client might be using different build IDs
2. **Caching Issues**: Browser or server caches might contain stale references
3. **Custom Server Middleware**: Middleware might be interfering with static asset serving
4. **Environmental Factors**: Turbo mode or caching configurations causing inconsistencies
5. **Memory Issues**: Not enough memory allocated for larger Next.js applications

## Comprehensive Solution

I've created a comprehensive reset script (`reset-next.sh`) that implements all known fixes for this issue:

### 1. Kill All Processes

Ensures no lingering Next.js processes are causing conflicts.

### 2. Clear All Caches

Removes all cached data from:
- `.next` directory
- `node_modules/.cache`
- `.turbo` cache directory

### 3. Reset Next.js Config

Touches the config file to trigger reloading.

### 4. Reinstall Next.js

Forces a fresh installation of Next.js to ensure correct version compatibility.

### 5. Rebuild in Standard Mode

Bypasses Turbo mode, which can sometimes cause issues with chunk generation.

### 6. Increase Memory Limits

Allocates more memory to Node.js for the build process.

### 7. Clear Browser Cache

Clearing browser cache is equally important, as browsers often cache static assets aggressively.

## How to Use

1. Stop any running Next.js processes
2. Run the comprehensive reset script:
   ```bash
   ./reset-next.sh
   ```
3. Clear your browser cache by:
   - Using hard refresh (Shift+Cmd+R on Mac, Shift+Ctrl+R on Windows)
   - Opening Dev Tools → Network tab → Disable Cache checkbox
   - Or use a private/incognito window

## Alternative Solutions

If the reset script doesn't resolve the issue:

1. **Development Only Solution**: Build for production and serve locally:
   ```bash
   next build && next start
   ```

2. **Disable Caching**:
   Add to your `.env.development` file:
   ```
   NEXT_DISABLE_INCREMENTAL_CACHE=1
   ```

3. **Change Ports**:
   Try explicitly running on a different port:
   ```bash
   next dev -p 3002
   ```

4. **Check Dependencies**:
   Look for conflicts in the `package.json` file, especially with:
   - React and React DOM versions
   - Next.js plugins and dependencies
   - Custom webpack or babel configurations
