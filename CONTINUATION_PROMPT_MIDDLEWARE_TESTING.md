## I'm continuing work on the Buildappswith platform. Here's the current context:

### General Information
* Current version: 1.0.77
* Working directory: /Users/liamj/Documents/Development/buildappswith
* Production branch: main (stable, deployed to production)
* Development branch: develop (integration branch for features)
* Branch for next session: feature/middleware-test-fixes (continuing from current branch)
* Feature branch naming convention: feature/[feature-name], bugfix/[issue-name], hotfix/[issue-name]
* Development stage: Post-MVP launch with stable production deployment

### Core Documentation
* PRD 2.1 - Comprehensive platform requirements
* CI_CD_PIPELINE.md - Branch management and deployment workflow
* PROJECT_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md - High-level maintenance procedures
* REQUIRED_SCRIPTS.md - Essential scripts for development and deployment
* ENVIRONMENT_MANAGEMENT.md - Environment variable configuration
* CHANGELOG.md - Detailed version history
* DECISIONS.md - Updated with middleware testing strategy decision
* MIDDLEWARE_TESTING_BACKLOG.md - Tracking outstanding middleware test issues

### Recent Progress
* Exported `mergeConfigs` function from config.ts to fix test imports
* Updated integration tests to expect 307 redirect status codes (Next.js 15.3.1)
* Modified performance tests to use flexible timing assertions
* Enhanced authentication mocking in factory tests
* Updated version numbers across all middleware files from 1.0.76 to 1.0.77
* Added detailed decision record for middleware testing strategy

### Technical Environment
* Frontend: Next.js 15.3.1 with App Router, React 19.1.0, TypeScript
* UI: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 with Magic UI components
* Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM v6.6.0
* Authentication: Clerk.js (migrated from NextAuth.js)
* Payment: Stripe integration
* Deployment: Vercel with GitHub integration
* Testing: Vitest configured with CommonJS format

### Available MCP Tools
* File system operations (read/write/edit)
* Run command and run script
* Directory management
* GitHub repository operations
* Brave web search
* 21st UI component tools
* Logo search

### Latest Codebase Changes
* /lib/middleware/config.ts: Exported mergeConfigs function and updated version
* /lib/middleware/performance.ts: Updated version and improved test compatibility
* /__tests__/middleware/integration.test.ts: Enhanced auth mocking, updated redirect status expectations
* /__tests__/middleware/factory.test.ts: Fixed authentication mocking implementation
* /__tests__/middleware/performance.test.ts: Changed fixed timing assertions to pattern matching
* /package.json: Updated version to 1.0.77
* /DECISIONS.md: Added middleware testing strategy decision
* /CHANGELOG.md: Updated with version 1.0.77 changes
* /MIDDLEWARE_TESTING_BACKLOG.md: Created to track outstanding issues

### Known Issues
* Factory Test Auth Issues: Tests for protected API routes and sign-in redirection still failing
* API Protection Flow: Tests for 401 unauthorized and 429 rate limiting responses failing
* Performance Test Headers: Still some issues with exact timing value expectations
* Test Order Dependencies: Some tests affected by the state of previously run tests
* Status Code Expectations: Mismatch between expected and actual status codes in integration tests

## Current Focus
Task description: Continue fixing the middleware test failures, focusing on the remaining issues with authentication flow, API protection, and status code expectations.

### Goals For This Session
1. Fix remaining factory test auth mocking issues for protected API routes
2. Address status code expectation issues in API protection flow tests
3. Improve auth middleware mocking to be more consistent across test files
4. Create a shared testing utility for authentication if appropriate

### Technical Requirements
* Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
* Follow Next.js 15.3.1 best practices
* Ensure backward compatibility with existing Clerk authentication
* Maintain comprehensive test coverage for middleware
* Update documentation with any significant changes
* Increment version number when changing code

### Working Methodology
* One component focus per session
* Clearly explain existing code before modifying
* Update CHANGELOG.md with significant changes, but only AFTER I have confirmed that any changes have been reflected in the application
* Increment version number in package.json
* Report any MCP failures explicitly
* Avoid assuming traditional development constraints apply
* Recognize that we can implement complex changes in a single session
* Focus on thorough but rapid implementation approaches
* Don't let perceived technical constraints artificially slow progress

### IMPORTANT
Before taking any action, please read through all the relevant documents first, especially:
1. The updated DECISIONS.md with our middleware testing strategy
2. The middleware module files (middleware.ts, lib/middleware/*.ts)
3. The test files in __tests__/middleware/
4. The MIDDLEWARE_TESTING_BACKLOG.md to understand remaining issues
5. The actual test output from the previous session

Use available MCP tools to examine the current codebase state to ensure full context and make no assumptions about the current state of the code. This is critical as the changes we've already made may have resolved some issues but introduced others.

I'd appreciate your help with continuing to fix the middleware test failures, focusing on the most critical issues first. Let's prioritize getting all tests passing consistently before adding any new functionality.
