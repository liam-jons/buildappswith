# Assets Directory

This directory contains various assets used throughout the Buildappswith platform.

## Directory Structure

- `/apps` - Screenshots and images of applications built by platform builders
- `/portfolio` - Images related to client success stories and portfolio items
- `/testimonials` - Profile images for testimonial providers

## Image Requirements

For best performance and compatibility, please follow these guidelines when adding images:

1. Use optimized images (WebP format preferred)
2. Maintain consistent aspect ratios:
   - Profile/avatar images: 1:1 (square)
   - App screenshots: 3:2 (landscape)
   - Portfolio images: 16:9 (widescreen)
3. Keep file sizes under 200KB per image
4. Include alt text in the code when using these images

## Fallback Handling

The platform includes graceful fallbacks for missing images. If an image doesn't load:

- Profile images: Will display initials on a gradient background
- App/Portfolio images: Will display a title with a text shimmer effect

## Adding New Images

When adding new images, please:

1. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `adhd-task-app.jpg` not `image1.jpg`)
2. Optimize images before adding them using a tool like TinyPNG or Squoosh
3. Document the image source and any licensing information in this README
