# Marketplace Routing Fix Summary

## Problem
The marketplace page was failing to load due to routing conflicts between:
- The main marketplace page
- Dynamic builder profile pages using the `/marketplace/[id]` pattern

## Changes Made
1. **Route Structure Improvement**:
   - Moved builder profiles from `/marketplace/[id]` to `/marketplace/builders/[id]`
   - This creates a clearer semantic structure and prevents routing conflicts

2. **References Updated**:
   - Modified builder card links to use the new structure
   - Updated links from `/marketplace/${id}` to `/marketplace/builders/${id}`

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed documentation explaining the issue and solution
   - Added recommendations for route structure best practices

## Testing
To verify these changes:
1. Run the `restart-after-routing-fix.sh` script to restart with a clean cache
2. Test the main marketplace page loads correctly
3. Test that builder profile pages work with the new URL structure

## Next Steps
- Consider updating API routes to match this structure for consistency
- Continue using the feature flag system for gradual feature rollouts

This fix resolves the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error by addressing the routing conflict that was causing the marketplace page to load incorrectly.
