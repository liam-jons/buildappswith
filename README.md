# Buildappswith

A platform democratizing AI application development through a marketplace connecting clients with validated builders and practical AI education.

## Vision

Buildappswith represents a transformative opportunity to bridge the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical application for non-technical users. Our platform operates on a "race to the top" model where builders are validated based on concrete success metrics rather than subjective reviews.

The core value proposition centers on three pillars:
1. **Accessible AI Education**: Making practical AI skills attainable for anyone
2. **Quality-Driven Marketplace**: Connecting clients with validated builders
3. **Community-Powered Growth**: Creating a virtuous cycle of skill development
