# Anonymous Booking Support Update

## Overview
Updated the booking system to properly support unauthenticated users booking free sessions, fixing the PrismaClientValidationError that was occurring when anonymous users tried to initialize bookings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Modified the `clientId` field in the `Booking` model to be nullable (`String?`)
- Created migration script to update production database: `make_client_id_nullable.sql`
- Created script to apply the change: `update-client-id-nullable.js`

### 2. API Endpoint Updates

#### Initialize Endpoint (`/api/scheduling/bookings/initialize/route.ts`)
- Made authentication optional (removed 401 error for unauthenticated users)
- Updated to handle anonymous users with `clientId` as 'anonymous' or null
- Modified logging to track both authenticated and unauthenticated bookings

#### New Create Endpoint (`/api/scheduling/bookings/create/route.ts`)
- Created new endpoint specifically for creating bookings after Calendly events
- Supports both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Extracts booking ID from Calendly custom question responses
- No authentication required

### 3. Storage Layer Update (`lib/scheduling/state-machine/storage.ts`)
- Updated to handle null `clientId` for anonymous users
- Added default values for required fields (title, startTime, endTime)
- Changed `clientId` from empty string fallback to `undefined` for proper null handling

### 4. Booking Flow Component Updates (`components/scheduling/client/booking-flow.tsx`)
- Modified to skip initialization for unauthenticated users
- Generate booking ID client-side for anonymous users
- Create booking after Calendly event is scheduled (not before)
- Added proper dispatch for session type selection without initialization
- Updated CalendlyEmbed to always include a booking ID (generated if not present)

### 5. Workflow Changes

#### For Authenticated Users:
1. Select session type → Initialize booking → Calendly scheduling → Payment (if needed)

#### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. Select session type → Calendly scheduling → Create booking → Payment (if needed)

## Implementation Notes

- Anonymous users can only book free sessions (enforced by UI filtering)
- Booking is created after Calendly event to avoid the need for authentication
- Booking ID is passed through Calendly custom questions for tracking
- Client ID is nullable in database to support anonymous bookings

## Next Steps

1. Run the database migration on production:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=<production_url> node scripts/update-client-id-nullable.js
   ```

2. Deploy the code changes

3. Test the booking flow for both authenticated and unauthenticated users

4. Set up Calendly webhooks as discussed in the implementation plan

## Error Resolution

The PrismaClientValidationError was caused by:
- Required `clientId` field in database
- Initialize endpoint requiring authentication
- Attempting to create bookings before having user information

This update resolves all these issues by:
- Making `clientId` nullable
- Creating bookings after Calendly events for anonymous users
- Providing alternative endpoints that don't require authentication
