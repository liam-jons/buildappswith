# Session Summary - Calendly Integration Debugging
**Date**: January 15, 2025  
**Branch**: feature/builder-cards  
**Focus**: Debugging Calendly integration issues and perpetual loading screen

## Problems Addressed

1. **Perpetual Loading Screen**
   - Calendly widget showed endless loading
   - Error: "Uncaught TypeError: null has no properties"
   - `window.Calendly` was not being initialized

2. **404 Errors**
   - Calendly returning 404 for event URLs
   - URLs like `https://calendly.com/liam-buildappswith/getting-started-businesses` not found

3. **CSP Blocking**
   - Content Security Policy blocking Calendly iframe
   - `frame-src` directive didn't include base `calendly.com` domain

4. **Full Site Loading in Widget**
   - When Calendly did load, it showed the entire Calendly website
   - Not just the calendar widget as expected

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed CSP Configuration
- Updated `next.config.mjs` to allow both `calendly.com` and `*.calendly.com`
- Added base domain to `frame-src` directive

### 2. Created Multiple Embed Approaches
- **CalendlyEmbed**: Enhanced original with retry logic
- **CalendlyEmbedSimple**: Uses data-url auto-initialization
- **CalendlyEmbedNative**: Uses traditional script tag approach

### 3. Fixed URL Format
- Database had URIs as `/event-name`
- Updated to `username/event-name` format
- Created scripts to verify and fix URI format

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added retry logic (up to 5 attempts)
- Improved debug logging
- Better error messages

## Key Discoveries

1. **Native Embed Works Best**
   - Traditional script tag approach more reliable
   - Bypasses Next.js Script component issues

2. **URL Format Matters**
   - Calendly expects specific URL format
   - Must match actual Calendly event URLs

3. **Event Slug Mismatch**
   - Our DB had descriptive slugs (e.g., "getting-started-businesses")
   - Calendly had generic slugs (e.g., "session-1")

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components
- `/components/scheduling/calendly/calendly-embed-simple.tsx`
- `/components/scheduling/calendly/calendly-embed-native.tsx`

### Test Pages
- `/app/calendly-test/page.tsx`
- `/app/calendly-direct-test/page.tsx`

### Debug Scripts
- `/scripts/check-calendly-urls.js`
- `/scripts/verify-calendly-format.js`
- `/scripts/fix-calendly-uri-format.js`

### Configuration
- `/next.config.mjs` - Updated CSP
- `/middleware.ts` - Added test pages to public routes

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Custom Calendar**
   - Check if we have existing calendar components
   - Consider building custom interface

2. **Calendly API Integration**
   - Explore API instead of iframe
   - Better control over booking flow

3. **Fix Widget Display**
   - Resolve full-site-in-iframe issue
   - Ensure only calendar widget shows

4. **Synchronize Event Slugs**
   - Match our DB slugs with Calendly's actual event URLs
   - Update database accordingly

## Recommendations

1. The native embed approach is most reliable
2. Consider API integration for better UX
3. We likely have custom calendar components that could provide better experience
4. Event slugs need to be synchronized with actual Calendly configuration

## Session Outcome

Successfully diagnosed and partially fixed the Calendly integration issues. The calendar now loads using the native embed approach, but still shows the full Calendly site instead of just the widget. Created comprehensive documentation and test infrastructure for continued development.
