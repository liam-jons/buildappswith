## Implementation Decisions

### [2025-04-15] Two-Line Animated Heading Layout

**Decision**: Implement a two-line heading with static text on first line and animated/dynamic text on second line.

**Context**: The inline animated heading occasionally caused layout issues with longer dynamic names, and we wanted to improve visual hierarchy of the heading components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep single-line approach with improved spacing (rejected due to potential layout shifts)
- Fixed-width container for dynamic text (rejected as limiting and potentially awkward)
- Reduced font size for dynamic text (rejected as visually inconsistent)
- Auto-scaling text based on length (rejected as too complex and potential UX issues)

**Chosen Approach**: Create dedicated TwoLineAnimatedHeading component with static "Build apps with" on first line and animated names on second line with clear vertical spacing.

**Consequences**:
- Improved visual stability with no layout shifts
- Better separation between static brand message and dynamic personalization
- Enhanced visual hierarchy that focuses attention on the changing names
- Consistent presentation across all device sizes
- Maintains all animation and accessibility features of original heading

### [2025-04-15] Hero Section Visualization Implementation

**Decision**: Implement an interactive SVG-based visualization showing the app building process with animated building blocks.

**Context**: The hero section needed a visual representation of the platform's core concept (democratizing app development) that would complement the animated heading and replace the static placeholder images.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Static imagery (rejected as less engaging)
- 3D visualization (rejected due to performance concerns and complexity)
- Canvas-based animation (rejected due to accessibility limitations)
- Video animation (rejected due to file size and loading concerns)
- Lottie animation (rejected due to file size and customization limitations)

**Chosen Approach**: SVG-based interactive visualization with Framer Motion animations, showing the app building process from AI foundation to final application, with building blocks representing different components.

**Consequences**:
- More engaging hero section that visually communicates the platform concept
- Lightweight implementation using SVG and Framer Motion for optimal performance
- Full accessibility support with aria labels and reduced motion preferences
- Visual reinforcement of the "Build apps with..." message from the animated heading
- Easy maintenance and customization compared to other animation approaches
- Consistent branding with the platform's color scheme and visual language

### [2025-04-15] Dynamic Heading Animation Implementation

**Decision**: Implement an animated heading with rotating names and highlighted keyword.

**Context**: The landing page needed a more dynamic, personalized headline that could showcase different users and maintain layout consistency.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Typing effect animation (rejected as too common and potentially distracting)
- Carousel of complete headline variations (rejected due to large text shifts)
- Static heading with changing background (rejected as less personalized)
- Multiple implementation approaches including flex-based, grid-based, and inline-based

**Chosen Approach**: Inline-based text structure with dedicated styling for each text component and whitespace control.

**Consequences**:
- More engaging landing page with personalized feel
- Increased visual interest while maintaining brand consistency
- Clear differentiation between static and dynamic content
- Support for future variations (e.g., "Learn AI with...") through modular approach
- Maintenance of layout consistency across all platforms and screen sizes

### [2025-04-15] Navigation Structure and Information Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a role-based navigation system with dropdown menus organized around platform components and user roles.

**Context**: The navigation structure needed to reflect the core platform components while also providing clear paths for different user types (Clients, Learners, Builders).

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple flat navigation (rejected due to complexity of platform)
- Role-only navigation (rejected as users need access to all platform components)
- Separate navigation per user role (rejected due to potential confusion when users switch roles)

**Consequences**:
- Clear pathways for different user types through the "I am a..." dropdown
- Direct access to core platform components through the "Platform" dropdown
- Mobile-friendly categorized navigation with detailed descriptions
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Foundation for future navigation expansion as more components are implemented

### [2025-04-15] Landing Page Content Strategy

**Decision**: Update landing page content to reflect platform-specific messaging focused on AI democratization.
