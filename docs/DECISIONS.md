# Project Decisions Log

This document tracks key technical and product decisions made during the development of the Buildappswith platform.

## Architecture Decisions

### [2025-04-15] Next.js with App Router

**Decision**: Use Next.js with App Router as the primary framework.

**Context**: Needed a modern React framework with strong TypeScript support, server-side rendering capabilities, and good developer experience.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Create React App (rejected due to lack of SSR support)
- Remix (rejected due to team familiarity with Next.js)
- Gatsby (rejected due to being more blog/static-site focused)

**Consequences**:
- Benefit from Next.js's robust ecosystem and performance optimizations
- Leverage App Router for more intuitive routing and layouts
- Future-proof the application with the latest React features

### [2025-04-15] Tailwind CSS for Styling

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling approach.

**Context**: Needed a styling solution that would enable rapid development, consistent design, and good performance.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CSS Modules (rejected due to verbosity)
- Styled Components (rejected due to runtime performance concerns)
- Vanilla CSS (rejected due to maintainability at scale)

**Consequences**:
- Faster UI development with utility classes
- Consistent design system through customized theme
- Smaller bundle size through PurgeCSS optimization

### [2025-04-15] Shadcn/UI Components Enhanced with Magic UI

**Decision**: Use Shadcn/UI components as a base and enhance them with Magic UI for visual appeal.

**Context**: Needed accessible, well-designed components that could be customized and extended.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Material UI (rejected due to distinct visual style)
- Chakra UI (rejected due to bundle size concerns)
- Building components from scratch (rejected due to time constraints)

**Consequences**:
- Leverage well-tested, accessible components
- Customize components to match our specific design needs
- Enhance visual appeal with Magic UI animations and effects

## Product Decisions

### [2025-04-15] Validation Tier System for Builder Profiles

**Decision**: Implement a three-tier validation system (Entry, Established, Expert) for builder profiles.

**Context**: Needed a way to establish credibility and trust in the marketplace while providing a clear progression path for builders.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Star rating system (rejected due to subjectivity)
- Single verification badge (rejected due to lack of progression)
- Detailed numerical scoring (rejected due to complexity)

**Consequences**:
- Clear progression path for builders to improve their profiles
- Easy-to-understand trust indicators for clients
- Objective criteria for validation based on portfolio, testimonials, and activity

### [2025-04-15] Free Session Offering in Builder Profiles

**Decision**: Include the ability for builders to offer free consultation sessions.

**Context**: Needed a way to reduce friction for initial client-builder connections and showcase builder expertise.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Paid-only sessions (rejected due to high barrier to entry)
- Platform-subsidized sessions (rejected due to financial constraints)
- Message-only initial contact (rejected due to inefficiency)

**Consequences**:
- Lower barrier to entry for clients to connect with builders
- Opportunity for builders to demonstrate expertise
- Potential increase in conversion to paid engagements

## Implementation Decisions

### [2025-04-15] Zod for Schema Validation

**Decision**: Use Zod for data validation throughout the application.

**Context**: Needed type-safe, runtime validation for forms and API endpoints.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Yup (rejected due to TypeScript integration quality)
- Joi (rejected due to bundle size and TypeScript support)
- Custom validation (rejected due to maintenance overhead)

**Consequences**:
- Type-safe validation with excellent TypeScript integration
- Schema reuse between frontend and backend
- Improved developer experience with clear error messages

### [2025-04-15] Builder Profile Data Model Structure

**Decision**: Design a comprehensive data model for builder profiles with nested objects for different profile sections.

**Context**: Needed a structured, type-safe way to represent builder profiles with multiple related components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flat data structure (rejected due to complexity in relationships)
- Multiple separate models (rejected due to overhead in managing relationships)
- Document-based approach (selected for flexibility and nested data)

**Consequences**:
- Clean, organized data structure
- Type safety across the application
- Flexibility to extend profile components in the future
