# Authentication Best Practices

## Security

### Secure Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Store all authentication secrets in environment variables, never in code
- **Key Rotation**: Implement processes for regular rotation of API keys and secrets
- **Clerk Webhook Secrets**: Use separate webhook secrets for different environments
- **Multiple Environment Support**: Maintain separate configurations for development, staging, and production
- **Domain Configuration**: Always specify proper domains in Clerk configuration

### Token Handling
- **Token Storage**: Use HTTP-only cookies for storing authentication tokens
- **Token Refresh**: Implement proper token refresh strategies before expiration
- **JWT Validation**: Always validate tokens on the server side
- **Session Timeouts**: Configure appropriate session and token timeouts based on security requirements
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF protection for all authenticated endpoints

### User Management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement fine-grained RBAC using Clerk's role system
- **Permission Verification**: Always verify permissions server-side, never trust client assertions
- **Email Verification**: Require email verification before granting access to sensitive features
- **Session Management**: Allow users to view and terminate active sessions
- **Account Recovery**: Implement secure account recovery flows

## Performance

### Authentication Optimization
- **Minimize Authentication Calls**: Cache authentication state where appropriate
- **Parallel Loading**: Load authentication and application content in parallel when possible
- **Progressive Loading**: Show content progressively rather than blocking on auth
- **Server Components**: Use React Server Components for authenticated pages to reduce client-side JS
- **Selective Authentication**: Only authenticate routes that actually require it

### Clerk SDK Usage
- **Singleton Initialization**: Initialize Clerk SDK once and reuse the instance
- **Lazy Loading**: Use dynamic imports to load auth components only when needed
- **Selective Imports**: Import only the specific Clerk components needed 
- **Minimal Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize the authentication bundle size
- **Clerk Express SDK**: Use the Express SDK for better performance and flexibility

### Caching Strategy
- **Cache Auth Status**: Cache authentication status at appropriate levels
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Use SWR patterns for authentication state
- **Revalidation Timing**: Revalidate auth state after user actions and at appropriate intervals
- **Prefetching**: Prefetch authentication state when possible
- **Server State Management**: Keep server-side auth state in sync with client

## Error Handling

### Authentication Failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide fallback experiences when authentication fails
- **Clear Error Messages**: Display user-friendly authentication error messages
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement automatic retry for transient authentication failures
- **Offline Support**: Handle authentication in offline scenarios
- **Expired Sessions**: Detect and handle expired sessions gracefully

### Error Reporting
- **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging for all authentication events
- **Error Classification**: Classify authentication errors appropriately
- **Sentry Integration**: Send authentication errors to Sentry with proper context
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track authentication performance metrics
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement React error boundaries specific to authentication

## Testing

### Authentication Testing
- **Mock Clerk SDK**: Create mock implementations of Clerk SDK for testing
- **Test User Accounts**: Maintain dedicated test user accounts with various roles
- **Integration Tests**: Test authentication flows with integration tests
- **E2E Testing**: Include authentication in end-to-end tests
- **Visual Regression**: Test authentication UI with visual regression tests

### Test Environments
- **Authentication Bypasses**: Create testing utilities to bypass authentication in tests
- **Test Middleware**: Implement test-specific authentication middleware
- **Role Simulation**: Test different user roles in isolation
- **Failure Scenarios**: Test authentication failure scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Measure authentication performance in tests

## Developer Experience

### Authentication Utilities
- **Auth Hooks**: Create simple, well-documented authentication hooks
- **Type Safety**: Provide full TypeScript types for authentication functions
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use consistent patterns for authentication checks
- **Component Helpers**: Create helper components for common auth patterns
- **Documentation**: Document authentication APIs comprehensively

### Debugging Tools
- **Auth Debugging Tools**: Provide tools for debugging authentication issues
- **Development Mode**: Create dev-only authentication utilities
- **State Inspection**: Allow inspection of authentication state in development
- **Auth Event Logging**: Log authentication events in development
- **Clerk Dashboard**: Integrate with Clerk dashboard for user management

## Specific Implementation Guidelines

### Express SDK Integration
- Use the Express SDK adapter consistently across the application
- Implement a clean adapter layer between Clerk and your application
- Maintain clear separation between auth providers and consumers
- Avoid deep coupling to Clerk APIs in application code
- Create stable interfaces for authentication that won't change with SDK updates

### Authentication State Management
- Use React Context for authentication state management
- Avoid prop drilling of authentication state
- Keep authentication state normalized and minimal
- Design for concurrent mode compatibility
- Implement proper state synchronization between tabs

### Protected Routes
- Use middleware for route protection when possible
- Implement consistent protection across client and server
- Create clear visual indicators for protected content
- Design clear access denied experiences
- Implement progressive enhancement for auth-protected features

### User Profile Integration
- Link Clerk profiles with application user profiles
- Maintain consistent role assignments between Clerk and your database
- Implement hooks for authentication events like sign-up and profile updates
- Create clear onboarding flows for new users
- Design for multi-tenant authentication if applicable

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Authentication Monitoring
- Monitor authentication success and failure rates
- Set up alerts for unusual authentication patterns
- Track key authentication metrics (active users, failed attempts, etc.)
- Monitor token usage and refresh patterns
- Log security-relevant authentication events

### Regular Maintenance
- Keep Clerk SDK updated to latest versions
- Review authentication configurations regularly
- Audit authentication logs periodically
- Validate security settings against best practices
- Test authentication flows after infrastructure changes
