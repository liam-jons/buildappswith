**Recommendation:** Replace with real testimonials or remove until verified content available

### Final CTA Section

**Body:** "Join Buildappswith today and start leveraging AI to create the applications you need."
- Regional Issues: "leveraging" could be "utilising"
- Recommendation: Update to "Start utilising AI to create..."

**Buttons:**
- "Sign Up Now" - Correct UK terminology
- "Just keep me informed for now" - Correct

## Language Conversion Required

### Spelling Changes Needed
No direct spelling issues found in current content, but future content should follow UK standards.

### Terminology Updates
1. "Sign Up" buttons - Already correct
2. "Program" vs "Programme" - Currently not used in content
3. References to "customers" could be "clients" for consistency

## Partner Verification Status

**Current Issue:** Companies listed in client section are technology partners, not client testimonials.

**Required Actions:**
1. Verify permission to display these logos
2. Clarify the purpose of this section
3. Consider separating "Technology Partners" from "Client Success Stories"

**Recommendations:**
1. Rename section to "Technology Ecosystem" or "Platform Partners"
2. Add disclaimers if logos are used without formal partnership agreements
3. Create separate section for actual client testimonials

## Content Gaps Identified

1. **ADHD Specialisation:** Liam's ADHD productivity expertise not prominently featured
2. **Builder Quality Focus:** The "Quality-Driven Marketplace" could better highlight the transparent trust architecture
3. **UK Market Focus:** Content could be more localised for UK audience
4. **Real Testimonials:** Need actual client testimonials to replace placeholders

## Recommended Content Updates

### Priority 1: Partner Section
Replace "BUILDING A TRUSTED ECOSYSTEM FOR AI LITERACY" with:
"Our Technology Ecosystem" or "Powered By Best-in-Class Technologies"

### Priority 2: Hero Section Enhancement
Add ADHD specialisation messaging:
"Start benefiting from AI today. Whether managing ADHD or transforming business ideas, become more efficient with specialised support."

### Priority 3: Testimonials
Replace placeholder testimonials with:
- Actual client testimonials (once available)
- Case studies focusing on successful outcomes
- Emphasis on ADHD productivity improvements

### Priority 4: UK Localisation
1. Update all future content to use UK English
2. Add UK-specific examples where relevant
3. Include UK-centric trust signals (UK business registration, compliance, etc.)

## Content Maintenance Workflow

1. **Review:** All new content reviewed against style guide
2. **Approval:** Content team approval for landing page changes
3. **Implementation:** Staged deployment with A/B testing
4. **Monitoring:** Track engagement metrics for updated content

## Next Steps

1. Verify partner permissions for logo usage
