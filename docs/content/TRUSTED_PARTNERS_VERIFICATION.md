## Section Purpose Clarification

### Current Usage
The client section currently displays technology partners/platforms rather than actual clients.

### Recommended Clarification
1. **Section Name Change**: "Technology Ecosystem" instead of "Client Section"
2. **Introductory Text**: "Powered by industry-leading technologies to ensure reliability and scalability"
3. **Disclaimer Addition**: "Company logos are used for identification purposes only and do not imply endorsement or partnership."

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Legal Review Required
- [ ] Review each company's logo usage guidelines
- [ ] Determine if current usage falls under fair use
- [ ] Identify which partnerships require formal agreements

### Step 2: Partnership Documentation
- [ ] Create formal partnership proposal templates
- [ ] Identify contact points for partnership discussions
- [ ] Prepare partnership benefits documentation

### Step 3: Alternative Approaches
1. **Generic Tech Stack Showcase**:
   - Display technology names as text without logos
   - Use technology categories instead of specific brands

2. **Verified Partnerships Only**:
   - Remove unverified logos
   - Add "Powered by Next.js, React, TypeScript" text-based tech stack

3. **Badge-Based Approach**:
   - Use official partner badges where available
   - Remove logos without official partnership status

## Immediate Recommendations
