\f0\fs24 \cf0 Buildappswith: PRD 3.0 Framework\
1. Executive Summary\
Buildappswith represents a transformative opportunity to democratize AI literacy through a human-centered marketplace and educational platform. In a world where AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, most people lack the understanding to apply these technologies meaningfully in their lives. Buildappswith bridges this gap by creating an ecosystem where anyone can learn about AI, connect with trusted experts, and build their future in an increasingly AI-driven world.\
The platform serves two primary purposes:\
	1	Creating a marketplace where users connect with verified builders for affordable custom solutions\
	2	Providing accessible education resources that empower anyone to understand and leverage AI effectively\
Our MVP will establish Liam Jons' profile as the foundation for marketplace growth, focusing on coaching sessions specialized in helping people with ADHD traits leverage AI for productivity. This initial focus provides immediate revenue while building toward our broader vision of a comprehensive "race to the top" ecosystem where builders compete on quality and value.\
Buildappswith stands apart through its commitment to trust, transparency, and human connection. We believe technology should serve humans, not the other way around. Our platform will become the trusted household name in AI education by maintaining this human-centered focus while creating sustainable revenue streams that align with our mission.\
2. Core Positioning and Value Proposition\
Market Position\
Buildappswith sits at the intersection of three rapidly evolving markets:\
	1	AI Education Market: Projected to reach $32.27 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 31.2%, driven by increasing demand for practical AI knowledge\
	2	Coaching Marketplace: Individual coaching sessions typically range from $150-500/hour, with group sessions averaging $30-50 per participant\
	3	AI Application Development: Traditional app development remains prohibitively expensive for most small businesses and individuals ($80-250/hour)\
Our unique position combines elements of all three while focusing on practical application and human connection.\
Unique Value Proposition\
For General Users: "Understand and leverage AI in your daily life through jargon-free education, curated tools, and personalized guidance from trusted experts."\
For Specialized Needs: "Accelerate your AI journey through verified builder connections, personalized coaching, and a supportive community that values quality over quantity."\
For Builders: "Build your reputation and income by helping others navigate the AI landscape while continuously evolving your own skills in a quality-focused marketplace."\
