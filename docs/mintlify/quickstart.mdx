# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with developing on the BuildAppsWith platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/buildappswith/buildappswith.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd buildappswith

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```
# Authentication
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# API Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

2. Set up your database:

```bash
# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev

# Or with nx
npx nx run buildappswith:dev
```

Your application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

The project follows a domain-based architecture:

```
/lib/             # Domain-based business logic
/app/             # Next.js app directory
/components/      # React components
/public/          # Static assets
/prisma/          # Database schema and migrations
```

## Using Domain Libraries

Import domain functionality using barrel exports:

```typescript
// Good - Use barrel exports
import { createCheckoutSession } from "@/lib/payment";
import type { PaymentStatus } from "@/lib/payment/types";
```

## Next Steps

- Check out the [API Reference](/api/overview) to learn about available APIs
- Browse the [Component Library](/components/overview) to see available UI components
