# Components Overview

BuildAppsWith uses a modular component system designed to provide consistent user interfaces across the platform. These components are organized hierarchically from basic UI elements to complex domain-specific components.

## Component Organization

Components are organized into these categories:

```
/components/
├── ui/               # Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
├── layout/           # Layout components (headers, footers, etc.)
├── [domain]/         # Domain-specific components (marketplace, profile, etc.)
└── shared/           # Cross-domain shared components
```

## Core UI Components

Our foundational UI components are built with accessibility and consistency in mind:

- **Buttons**: Primary, secondary, ghost, and link variants
- **Inputs**: Text inputs, select dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons
- **Cards**: Content containers with various layouts
- **Typography**: Headings, paragraphs, and text elements
- **Feedback**: Toasts, alerts, and error messages

## Component Usage

To use a component in your page or feature:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={handleClick}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Domain-Specific Components

Each domain has its own set of specialized components:

### Marketplace Components

Components specific to the marketplace experience, such as:

- Builder cards
- Search filters
- Rating displays
- Skill badges

### Profile Components

Components for user profiles:

- Profile headers
- Experience sections
- Portfolio galleries
- Social links

## Design Principles

Our components follow these design principles:

1. **Consistent**: Maintain visual and behavioral consistency
2. **Accessible**: Follow WCAG accessibility guidelines
3. **Responsive**: Work across all device sizes
4. **Reusable**: Designed to be used in multiple contexts
5. **Type-Safe**: Strictly typed props and events

## Component Architecture

Each component follows a standard structure:

```tsx
// Component definition with TypeScript props
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost' | 'link';
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
  // Other props...
}

// Component implementation
export function Button({ variant, size = 'medium', children, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  // Implementation...
}
```

## Styling Approach

Components are styled using a combination of:

- Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
- CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- CSS Variables for theming and customization

## Future Component Development

As we continue to develop the component system, we plan to:

1. Create a standalone component library in the Nx workspace
2. Implement a comprehensive Storybook documentation
3. Enhance accessibility features
4. Add more specialized domain components
