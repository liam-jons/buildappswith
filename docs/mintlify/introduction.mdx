## Architecture

BuildAppsWith follows a domain-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
/lib/[domain]/
├── actions.ts        # Server actions
├── api.ts            # Client-side API functions
├── schemas.ts        # Zod schemas
├── types.ts          # Type definitions
├── utils.ts          # Utility functions
└── index.ts          # Barrel exports
```

Each domain encapsulates a specific area of functionality, with clean interfaces between domains.
