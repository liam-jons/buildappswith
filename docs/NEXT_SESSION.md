### Component Description
The Builder Discovery component is a critical part of the marketplace functionality, allowing clients to find and evaluate builders based on their validation metrics, specializations, and availability. This component needs to effectively showcase builder profiles with appropriate filtering and sorting capabilities.

### Tasks
1. Create the initial builder discovery interface with:
   - Search functionality with filters for specialization, validation level, and availability

2. Implement builder profile card component with:
   - Profile photo/avatar
   - Name and validation tier indicator
   - Key specializations

   - Availability status

3. Design the detailed builder profile page accessible from the cards with:
   - Comprehensive profile information
