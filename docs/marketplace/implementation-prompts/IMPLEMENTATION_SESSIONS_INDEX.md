# Builder Card V2 Implementation Sessions Index

## Overview

This index provides a roadmap for implementing the Builder Card V2 redesign through focused development sessions. Each session is designed to be completed independently while building upon previous work.

## Implementation Timeline

Total Duration: 10 weeks
Sessions: 5 focused implementation phases

## Session Sequence

### [Session 1: Foundation Implementation](./SESSION_1_FOUNDATION.md)
**Duration**: Weeks 1-2  
**Focus**: Data models, API endpoints, database schema, component architecture  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Extended TypeScript interfaces
- New API endpoints for pathways and metrics
- Database migrations
- Component folder structure
- Feature flag configuration

### [Session 2: Core Components Implementation](./SESSION_2_CORE_COMPONENTS.md)
**Duration**: Weeks 3-4  
**Focus**: Building the redesigned card components with pathway integration  
**Key Deliverables**:
- BuilderCardV2 main component
- PathwayIndicators with tooltips
- SkillsList with bullet format
- SessionAvailability badges
- BuilderMetrics display
- CardActions with auth awareness

### [Session 3: Enhanced Features Implementation](./SESSION_3_ENHANCED_FEATURES.md)
**Duration**: Weeks 5-6  
**Focus**: Advanced features, animations, and polish  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Expandable metrics dashboard
- ValidationTierKey component
- Loading and error states
- Smooth animations
- Modal views
- Performance optimizations

### [Session 4: Testing & Optimization Implementation](./SESSION_4_TESTING_OPTIMIZATION.md)
**Duration**: Weeks 7-8  
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing and performance optimization  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Unit test suite (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests
- E2E test scenarios
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility compliance
- Visual regression tests

### [Session 5: Deployment Implementation](./SESSION_5_DEPLOYMENT.md)
**Duration**: Weeks 9-10  
**Focus**: Production deployment with monitoring and gradual rollout  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Feature flag configuration
- Monitoring setup
- Gradual rollout plan
- Complete documentation
- Alert configuration
- Production deployment

Session 5 (Deployment)
```

## Success Criteria

Each session should achieve:
- All deliverables completed
- Code reviewed and approved
- Tests passing
- Documentation updated
- No critical bugs
- Performance within budget

## Resource Requirements

- 2 Frontend Engineers (full-time)
- 1 Backend Engineer (50%)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (25%)
- 1 QA Engineer (50%)
- 1 Product Manager (25%)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Performance degradation → Implement lazy loading
- Data inconsistency → Use database transactions
- Browser compatibility → Progressive enhancement

### Process Risks
- Scope creep → Stick to session objectives
- Dependencies → Clear session boundaries
- Timeline slippage → Regular check-ins

## Communication Plan

- Daily standups during active sessions
- Weekly stakeholder updates
- Session completion reviews
- Retrospectives after each phase

## Next Steps

1. Review all session prompts
2. Confirm resource allocation
3. Schedule Session 1 kickoff
4. Set up tracking mechanisms
5. Begin implementation

## Quick Reference

| Session | Duration | Focus Area | Key Output |
|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Weeks 1-2 | Foundation | Data models & APIs |
| 2 | Weeks 3-4 | Components | Core UI implementation |
| 3 | Weeks 5-6 | Features | Enhanced functionality |
| 4 | Weeks 7-8 | Testing | Quality assurance |
| 5 | Weeks 9-10 | Deployment | Production release |

## Notes

- Each session builds on the previous one
- Sessions can be adjusted based on progress
- Regular reviews ensure alignment
- Documentation is updated continuously
- Rollback plans exist for each phase
