# Buildappswith: PRD 3.0 - Democratizing AI Through Human-Centered Design

## 1. Executive Summary

Buildappswith represents a transformative opportunity to democratize AI application development and literacy through a human-centered platform operating at the intersection of education and marketplace functionality. As AI capabilities accelerate in 2025, we find ourselves at a critical inflection point where the gap between technological potential and practical understanding threatens to leave many behind.

This Product Requirements Document (PRD 3.0) introduces a strategic evolution that integrates three critical dimensions:

1. **Attention Architecture**: A cognitive science-based framework that optimizes user engagement through progressive disclosure, multi-modal learning, and attention management—ensuring both novice and expert users experience continuous value.

2. **Acquisition Ecosystem**: A multi-channel strategy that creates self-sustaining growth through targeted content, community-driven expansion, and strategic partnerships aligned with distinct user journey stages.

3. **Trust Development System**: A multi-dimensional approach to building, visualizing, and maintaining trust through transparent validation, outcome verification, and ethical practice demonstration.

Our MVP will establish Liam Jons' profile as the foundation for marketplace growth, where Liam will offer coaching services, with a primary focus on four main areas: (i) helping people with ADHD traits leverage AI for productivity, (ii) helping people who are early in their journey with AI, (iii) helping people understand how to work with AI, to enable them to build, and (iv) helping businesses find where the true value lies for them with AI, both right now, and in future. This initial focus provides immediate revenue while building toward the broader vision of a comprehensive "race to the top" ecosystem.

By implementing this integrated strategy, Buildappswith will:
- Deliver measurable value within five minutes of initial engagement
- Create a self-reinforcing community that drives organic growth
- Establish transparent trust metrics that elevate quality providers
- Build AI literacy through practical, accessible education

The platform's success will be measured not just through business metrics (revenue, user growth), but through mission fulfillment indicators that track democratization impact, AI literacy improvement, and human-AI synergy effectiveness.

This document provides a comprehensive blueprint for executing this vision, with clear responsibilities, resource requirements, and implementation priorities designed to maximize impact while maintaining operational efficiency.

## 2. Strategic Framework

                               /  \
                              /    \
                             /      \
                            /        \
                           /          \
