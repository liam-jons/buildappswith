	•	Environmental optimization suggestions
Implementation Example: Attention Management
const AttentionManagement = ({ userInteractions, sessionMetrics }) => {
  // Analyze interaction patterns for fatigue indicators
  const fatigueLevel = detectFatigueLevel(userInteractions, sessionMetrics);
  
  // Only show intervention when needed
  if (fatigueLevel >= FATIGUE_THRESHOLD) {
    return (
      <AttentionIntervention
        fatigueLevel={fatigueLevel}
        suggestionType={determineBestIntervention(userProfile, currentTask)}
        dismissCallback={() => logInterventionResponse('dismissed')}
        acceptCallback={() => logInterventionResponse('accepted')}
      />
    );
  }
  
  return null; // No intervention needed
};
Cognitive Context Switching
The platform minimizes the cognitive cost of context switching through specialized features:

	•	Clear task completion indicators before switching
	•	Context relationship visualization
Implementation Example: Context Handling
const ContextHandler = ({ currentContext, navigationHistory }) => {
  // When context changes, handle the transition
  useEffect(() => {
    if (previousContext && previousContext !== currentContext) {
      // Save previous context state
      saveContextState(previousContext);
      
      // Generate transition guidance
      const transitionHelp = generateTransitionGuidance(
        previousContext, 
        currentContext,
        navigationHistory
      );
      
      // Show appropriate transition assistance
      if (transitionHelp) {
        showTransitionAssistance(transitionHelp);
      }
    }
    
    // Restore context state if returning to previous context
    if (hasVisitedBefore(currentContext)) {
      restoreContextState(currentContext);
    }
  }, [currentContext]);
  
  return (
    <ContextWrapper>
      <ContextBreadcrumbs history={navigationHistory} />
      <CurrentContextIndicator context={currentContext} />
      {children}
      <ContextBookmarker current={currentContext} />
    </ContextWrapper>
  );
};

  // Determine which features should be introduced in current context
  const relevantFeatures = identifyRelevantFeatures(
    availableFeatures, 
    userContext,
    userJourney
  );
  
  // Find the highest priority feature to introduce
  const featureToIntroduce = selectHighestPriorityFeature(relevantFeatures);
  
  // Only show introduction if appropriate
  if (featureToIntroduce && shouldIntroduceNow(featureToIntroduce, userContext)) {
    return (
      <FeatureIntroduction
        feature={featureToIntroduce}
        introMethod={determineOptimalIntroMethod(featureToIntroduce, userContext)}
        onDismiss={() => logIntroductionResponse('dismissed')}
        onExplore={() => logIntroductionResponse('explored')}
      />
    );
  }
  
  return null; // No introduction needed
