# Authentication Routes Standardization Implementation

## Overview

This document details the standardization of authentication routes in the BuildAppsWith platform to use the consistent paths `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` instead of inconsistent variants like `/login`, `/signin`, and `/signup`.

## Changes Implemented

### Route Structure Changes

1. Created standardized routes following Clerk's recommended catch-all pattern:
   - `/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` (Client component)
   - `/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` (Client component)

2. Added layout components for metadata handling:
   - `/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/layout.tsx`
   - `/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/layout.tsx`

3. Updated middleware configuration:
   - Added new route patterns to public routes list
   - Updated authenticated page redirects

4. Added redirects in `next.config.mjs`:
   - `/login` → `/sign-in`
   - `/signin` → `/sign-in`
   - `/signup` → `/sign-up`
   - `/register` → `/sign-up`

### Component Implementation

1. Updated `ClerkAuthForm` component:
   - Enhanced to support routing configuration
   - Added support for path, signInUrl, and signUpUrl props
   - Properly handles theme via useTheme hook

2. Made authentication pages client components:
   - Added "use client" directive to both page components
   - Moved metadata to layout components
   - Integrated with enhanced ClerkAuthForm

### Build-Related Changes

To address build issues encountered during implementation:

1. Temporarily disabled Sentry integration:
   - Commented out imports in `next.config.mjs`
   - Disabled Sentry hooks in instrumentation files
   - Temporarily renamed Sentry config files
   - Created reset scripts for troubleshooting

2. Created reset scripts:
   - `reset-next-auth.sh`: Focused on auth-related reset
   - `reset-dev.sh`: Simple cache clearing and restart
   - `reset-next-full.sh`: Comprehensive reset script

## Current Status and Issues

The standardized routes work correctly in the development environment but encounter build errors in production. The main errors are:

1. MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors related to Sentry integration
2. Webpack runtime errors with module resolution

Disabling Sentry temporarily allows development to proceed, but a comprehensive solution for production builds requires further investigation.

## Next Steps

A dedicated investigation is needed to address the production build errors while maintaining the standardized authentication routes. This should focus on:

1. Clerk Express SDK compatibility with Next.js App Router
2. Client/server component boundaries in authentication pages
3. Sentry integration in Next.js 13+ with the App Router
4. Proper module resolution in production builds
