## Component Background

The Buildappswith platform requires comprehensive E2E testing to ensure high-quality user experiences across critical user flows. Our initial Playwright implementation has established the foundational infrastructure, but systematic test coverage for core platform functionality is needed. The E2E test directory structure follows our domain-first organization pattern, but most domains lack implemented tests.

Our authentication testing has begun with a signin.test.ts file that tests basic login flows with proper selectors and validation. However, we need to expand testing to cover the complete user journey across our three priority areas:

1. **Authentication flows** (signup, login, account management, role-based access)
2. **Booking journey** (builder selection, scheduling, payment, confirmation)
3. **Marketplace discovery** (browsing, filtering, profile viewing)

These areas represent the most critical user journeys and therefore require thorough, reliable E2E test coverage to ensure the platform functions correctly across different devices and browsers.

## Current State Assessment

Our E2E testing infrastructure includes:

- Playwright configuration that supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop and mobile)
- Directory structure aligned with our domain-first organization
- Initial authentication testing for the signin flow
- Test result reporting setup for HTML and JSON outputs
- Foundational configuration for screenshot capturing and tracing

However, several challenges need to be addressed:

- Lack of test data seeding strategy for consistent test environments
- Need for reliable handling of authentication state between tests
- Absence of strategies for handling asynchronous operations in the booking flow
- No tests for the payment integration with Stripe
- Missing visual testing approach for critical UI components
- Need for cross-browser/device test coordination

## Planning Objectives

1. **Test User Strategy**
   - Define test user personas with specific roles (client, builder, admin)

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Design database seeding approach for consistent test environments
   - Create builder profiles with predictable attributes for reliable selection
   - Develop session type definitions with controlled availability
   - Establish cleanup processes to reset test state between runs

3. **Authentication Testing Plan**
   - Map complete authentication user journeys (signup, signin, profile management)
   - Design role-switching test scenarios
   - Plan for testing authorization boundaries and error cases
   - Develop strategies for maintaining authenticated state across tests

### User Management Approach

For reliable test execution, we will:

1. **Pre-seed test users** in the test environment database
2. **Use an authentication helper** to log in users programmatically
3. **Store authentication state** using Playwright's storage state feature
4. **Implement role-based fixtures** for quick access to authenticated contexts

## Test Data Seeding Approach

To ensure consistent test environments, we will implement:

### Database Seeding

1. **Pre-test seeding script** that runs before test execution
2. **Domain-specific fixtures** for marketplace, booking, and profiles
3. **Deterministic data generation** with fixed IDs and attributes
4. **Environment-aware seeding** that adapts to local, CI, and staging environments

### Specific Test Datasets
