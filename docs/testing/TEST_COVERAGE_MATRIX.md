# Test Coverage Matrix

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** May 10, 2025
**Status:** Approved
**Key Stakeholders:** Engineering Team, QA

## Overview

This document maps user roles to features and test coverage, ensuring comprehensive testing across the BuildAppsWith platform. It serves as a reference for understanding which features are tested, at what levels, and by which test suites.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Coverage**: Mapping of features to test coverage types
- **Role-Based Testing**: Testing features with appropriate user roles
- **Test Types**: Unit, component, integration, and E2E tests
- **Test Location**: Where test files are located
- **Coverage Status**: Current implementation status of tests

## Critical Path Coverage

The following critical user paths are tested end-to-end:

1. **New User Registration and Profile Creation**
   - Sign up → Email verification → Complete profile → Browse marketplace
   - Test Location: `__tests__/e2e/auth/auth-flow.test.ts`
   
2. **Client Booking Journey**
   - Browse marketplace → View builder profile → Select session → Book session → Payment → Confirmation
   - Test Location: `__tests__/e2e/booking/booking-flow.test.ts`
   
3. **Builder Profile and Availability Management**
   - Sign in → Update profile → Set session types → Manage availability → View bookings
   - Test Location: `__tests__/e2e/profile/profile-management.test.ts`
   
4. **Admin Builder Verification**
   - Admin sign in → View pending verifications → Verify builder → Check builder tier
   - Test Location: `__tests__/e2e/auth/profile-management.test.ts`
   
5. **Booking Management Workflow**
   - View bookings → Reschedule session → Cancel booking → Refund processing
   - Test Location: `__tests__/e2e/booking/booking-management.test.ts`

## Coverage Gaps and Priorities

Based on the current implementation status, the following areas require additional test coverage:

### High Priority

1. **Portfolio Management**
   - Missing E2E tests for portfolio creation and management
   - Action: Implement E2E tests in `__tests__/e2e/profile/`
   
2. **Admin User Management**
   - Limited coverage of admin functionality
   - Action: Implement component and API tests in `__tests__/components/admin` and `__tests__/api/admin`

3. **Rescheduling Workflow**
   - Partial coverage of rescheduling edge cases
   - Action: Complete E2E tests in `__tests__/e2e/booking/booking-management.test.ts`

### Medium Priority

1. **Builder Analytics**
   - Currently planned but not implemented
   - Action: Implement component tests in `__tests__/components/profile`
   
2. **Email Verification Flow**
   - Partial E2E coverage
   - Action: Complete E2E tests in `__tests__/e2e/auth/`

3. **Recommendations System**
   - Partial integration test coverage
   - Action: Complete integration tests in `__tests__/integration/auth-marketplace`

### Low Priority

1. **Content Management**
   - Currently planned only
   - Action: Implement as needed when feature is developed
   
2. **Feature Flag Management**
   - Currently planned only
   - Action: Implement as needed when feature is developed
