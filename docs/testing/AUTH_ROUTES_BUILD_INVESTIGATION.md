# Authentication Routes Build Investigation

## Session Context

  - **Session Type**: Investigation (Build Errors with Clerk Express Authentication)
  - **Focus Area**: Production Build Errors after Authentication Routes Standardization
  - **Current Branch**: feature/datadog-update
  - **Related Documentation**: 
    - `/docs/testing/AUTH_ROUTES_STANDARDIZATION.md`
    - `/docs/engineering/CLERK_AUTH_ROUTES_INVESTIGATION.md`

## Investigation Background

This investigation session addresses critical build failures that have emerged after standardizing authentication routes to use `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` with Clerk's recommended catch-all pattern `[[...sign-in]]`. While the routes render correctly in development, they fail to build properly for production.

The implementation follows Clerk's documentation for catch-all route patterns and uses client components with proper "use client" directives. However, when attempting to build for production, various module resolution errors occur, particularly related to Sentry integration and potential client/server component boundary issues.

Temporary workarounds by disabling Sentry have not fully resolved the issue, indicating deeper problems with the module resolution or component structure in the build pipeline.

## Investigation Objectives

- Analyze build errors to identify the root cause of module resolution failures
- Examine the relationship between Clerk's catch-all routes and Next.js App Router
- Investigate client/server component boundaries in authentication pages
- Evaluate potential conflicts between Sentry instrumentation and Clerk authentication
- Research Next.js best practices for catch-all routes with authentication
- Review Clerk Express SDK implementation and its compatibility with the app's architecture
- Identify why components work in development but fail in production builds
- Develop a comprehensive solution that allows both standardized routes and proper builds

## Specific Error Messages to Investigate

1. Module resolution errors:
   ```
   Error: Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/@sentry+core@9.14.0.js'
   Require stack:
   - /Users/liamj/Documents/development/buildappswith/.next/server/webpack-runtime.js
   - /Users/liamj/Documents/development/buildappswith/.next/server/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.js
   ```

2. Additional webpack errors:
   ```
   - /Users/liamj/Documents/development/buildappswith/node_modules/.pnpm/next@15.3.1_@babel+core@7.26.10_@opentelemetry+api@1.8.0_@playwright+test@1.52.0_react-_3039b744aa7720852471c23854274826/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/start-server.js
   at __webpack_require__.f.require (.next/server/webpack-runtime.js:206:28)
   ```

## Expected Outputs

- Root cause analysis of build failures
- Detailed examination of Clerk catch-all route pattern implementation
- Client/server component boundary assessment
- Sentry integration compatibility analysis
- Clear remediation strategy that preserves standardized routes
- Recommended implementation approach that works in both development and production
- Guidelines for future authentication-related changes

## Research Focus Areas

- Next.js App Router catch-all routes with authentication providers
- Client vs. server component boundaries with external authentication libraries
- Proper instrumentation and monitoring with authentication routes
- Webpack module resolution in Next.js production builds
- Clerk Express SDK integration patterns with Next.js 13+
- Build optimization and troubleshooting for authentication components
