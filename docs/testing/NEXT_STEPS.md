# Testing Implementation: Next Steps

## Current Status and Challenges

We've made significant progress with the testing infrastructure implementation, but have encountered several challenges that need to be addressed:

1. **MSW Integration Issues**: The Mock Service Worker (MSW) dependency has been added, but we're experiencing integration issues with our test framework. Tests that rely on MSW for API mocking are failing because of module resolution issues.

2. **Playwright Configuration Problems**: End-to-end tests using Playwright are failing due to configuration issues, particularly when using `test.use()` to specify authentication. We've started to fix this by creating a separate configuration and using fixtures.

3. **Module Import Errors**: Several tests are failing due to missing modules or incorrect import paths. This indicates a need for better module organization or proper mocking strategies.

4. **Mock Implementation Issues**: Tests that use mock implementations like `mockResolvedValueOnce` are failing because the mocks aren't set up correctly. This suggests a need for standardized mocking patterns.

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Fix MSW Integration**:
   - Ensure MSW is properly initialized in the test setup
   - Create a central place for handler definitions
   - Verify MSW is working with a simple test case

2. **Update Playwright Configuration**:
   - Implement the updated configuration with proper project definitions
   - Update existing tests to use fixtures instead of `test.use()`
   - Fix the syntax error in the Calendly booking flow test

3. **Standardize Mocking Patterns**:
   - Create clear documentation on how to mock modules
   - Implement helper functions for common mocking scenarios
   - Ensure consistent mocking patterns across all tests

4. **Resolve Module Import Issues**:
   - Fix import paths for missing modules
   - Create mock implementations for external dependencies
   - Ensure proper module resolution in the test environment

## Medium-term Goals

1. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Implement tests for critical business logic
   - Cover primary user journeys
   - Add tests for error cases and edge conditions

2. **Database Testing Improvements**:
   - Implement transaction isolation for database tests
   - Create seed data scripts for test scenarios
   - Ensure proper cleanup after tests

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for running tests
   - Implement test reporting and visualization
   - Create status checks for pull requests

## Clerk Migration Planning

1. **Document Current Usage**:
   - Identify all locations where Clerk SDK is used
   - Document authentication and authorization patterns
   - Map out user roles and permissions

2. **Research Express Migration**:
   - Understand the new `@clerk/express` API
   - Identify breaking changes and required updates
   - Create migration test cases

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Create a detailed timeline for migration
   - Identify potential risks and mitigations
   - Develop a phased approach for implementation

## Team Coordination

1. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Document testing patterns and best practices
   - Hold a short workshop on the testing infrastructure
   - Create examples of well-tested components

2. **Code Review Guidelines**:
   - Establish expectations for test coverage
   - Create checklist for test quality
   - Ensure tests are reviewed alongside code changes

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Set up monitoring for test success rates
   - Schedule regular maintenance of the test suite
   - Track test performance over time

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (May 2025)**: Fix immediate issues and stabilize the test environment
2. **Phase 2 (June 2025)**: Expand test coverage to core functionality
3. **Phase 3 (July 2025)**: Integrate with CI/CD and implement reporting
4. **Phase 4 (August-December 2025)**: Plan and execute Clerk migration
