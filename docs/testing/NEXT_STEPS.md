# Testing Implementation: Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for the BuildAppsWith testing infrastructure.

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Fix Remaining Test Failures**
   - Complete comprehensive test for all booking flow components
   - ✅ Resolve any remaining MSW integration issues in specific tests
   - ✅ Fix Calendly service and API client tests
   - ✅ Create documentation for MSW test fixes and common issues
   - Fix timing issues in async tests

2. **Complete Test Coverage for Critical Paths**
   - Implement missing unit tests for core components
   - Add integration tests for auth-marketplace interaction
   - Create E2E tests for booking payment flow

3. **Verify GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Test the full CI workflow locally
   - Ensure proper test database setup in CI
   - Verify coverage reporting to Datadog

4. **Database Testing Utilities**
   - Implement proper test data seeding
   - Enhance transaction isolation for database tests
   - Create factory functions for all entity types

## Medium Term Goals

1. **Test Coverage Targets**
   - Achieve 80% coverage for critical paths
   - Ensure all API endpoints have corresponding tests
   - Create visual regression tests for key UI components

2. **Clerk Migration**
   - Migrate from deprecated `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` to `@clerk/express`
   - Update mock implementations for new API
   - Create migration guide for tests using Clerk authentication

3. **E2E Testing Enhancement**
   - Expand Playwright tests for all user journeys
   - Implement visual comparison testing
   - Create accessibility testing workflow

4. **Test Performance Optimization**
   - Improve test speed through better mocking
   - Implement parallel test execution where possible
   - Optimize database reset between tests

## Documentation Needs

1. **Test Patterns Guide**
   - Document common test patterns for components
   - Create examples for API testing
   - Provide guidelines for E2E testing

2. **Component Testing Checklist**
   - Create checklist for component test requirements
   - Document accessibility testing requirements
   - Outline visual testing approaches

3. **Mock Data Management**
   - Document approach to creating and managing mock data
   - Create standards for test data consistency
   - Outline factory pattern usage

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Inconsistent Test Patterns**
   - Standardize test approach across codebase
   - ✅ Apply dependency injection patterns for better testability
   - Refactor tests using deprecated patterns
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions

2. **Missing Unit Tests**
   - Add missing tests for utility functions
   - Create tests for hooks and context providers
   - Implement tests for Redux/state management

3. **Outdated Mock Implementations**
   - ✅ Update mock implementations for Calendly API
   - ✅ Improve environment variable handling in tests
   - Create consistent patterns for API mocks
   - Document mock strategy for external dependencies

## Development Process Integration

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Add pre-commit hooks for running affected tests
   - Enforce test coverage thresholds
   - Implement lint rules for test files

2. **Pull Request Workflow**
   - Create PR template with testing checklist
   - Automate test coverage reporting on PRs
   - Implement test status badges

3. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Document TDD approach for new features
   - Create examples of TDD workflow
   - Train team on TDD practices

## Clerk SDK Migration Plan

The Clerk SDK migration requires attention before January 2025:

1. **Assessment Phase** (Immediate)
   - Identify all usages of `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`
   - Document API differences between old and new SDKs
   - Create test cases for verification

2. **Implementation Phase** (Q3 2024)
   - Migrate to `@clerk/express` in server code
   - Update authentication middleware
   - Modify webhook handlers

3. **Testing Phase** (Q4 2024)
   - Update mock implementations in tests
   - Verify all auth-dependent tests
   - Ensure backward compatibility where needed

4. **Verification Phase** (December 2024)
   - Run all tests with new SDK
   - Perform manual testing of auth flows
   - Deploy to staging environment
