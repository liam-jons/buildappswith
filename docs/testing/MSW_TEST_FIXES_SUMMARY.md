# MSW Test Fixes Summary

This document outlines the changes made to fix the issues with the MSW integration tests for the Calendly-Stripe integration.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Processing Webhook Events in Service Tests**:
   - Tests were failing with "expected null not to be null" because private methods in the service were inaccessible.
   - Solution: Mocked private methods in tests by typing service as `any` to allow direct access.

2. **Environment Variable Dependencies in API Client Tests**:
   - Tests were failing because they depend on Calendly API tokens from environment variables.
   - Solution: 
     - Used `vi.stubEnv()` to mock environment variables
     - Mocked the key manager module to provide test tokens

3. **Network Request Failures in Tests**:
   - Direct network requests were failing during tests due to actual HTTP calls.
   - Solution: 
     - Replaced direct API client calls with mocked implementations
     - Used mock functions instead of MSW for consistent behavior

## Approach Taken

### For Service Tests

1. Typed the service instance as `any` to allow access to private methods:
   ```typescript
   let service: any; // Using any to allow adding private method mocks
   ```

2. Directly mocked the private handler methods:
   ```typescript
   // Mock the private method directly using any type
   service.processEventCreated = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
     builderId: 'builder-1',
     clientId: 'client-1',
     sessionTypeId: 'session-1',
     calendlyEventId: eventId,
     status: 'PENDING'
   });
   ```

### For API Client Tests

1. Mocked environment variables for Calendly API tokens:
   ```typescript
   // Mock environment variables for Calendly API tokens
   vi.stubEnv('CALENDLY_API_TOKEN', 'test-calendly-token');
   vi.stubEnv('CALENDLY_API_TOKEN_SECONDARY', 'test-calendly-secondary-token');
   ```

2. Mocked the key manager module to avoid real API calls:
   ```typescript
   vi.mock('@/lib/scheduling/calendly/key-manager', () => ({
     getCalendlyKeyManager: () => ({
       getToken: () => 'test-token',
       markTokenFailed: vi.fn()
     }),
     TokenStatus: {
       ACTIVE: 'active',
       INVALID: 'invalid'
     }
   }));
   ```

3. Created mock implementations for API methods instead of relying on MSW:
   ```typescript
   const mockApiClient = {
     getEventType: mockGetEvent
   };
   ```

## Documentation Updates

1. Added new common issues to the troubleshooting section of MSW_INTEGRATION_FIXES.md:
   - Environment Variable Dependencies
   - Private Method Testing

2. Provided code examples and recommended solutions

## Future Recommendations

1. **Dependency Injection**: Consider implementing dependency injection patterns for services to make testing easier:
   ```typescript
   constructor(client: CalendlyApiClient, prisma?: PrismaClient) {
     this.client = client;
     this.prisma = prisma || new PrismaClient();
   }
   ```

2. **Service Interface Definition**: Define interfaces for services to enable mock implementations:
   ```typescript
   interface ICalendlyService {
     getEventTypes(): Promise<MappedCalendlyEventType[]>;
     createSchedulingLink(request: CalendlySchedulingLinkRequest): Promise<CalendlySchedulingLinkResponse>;
     processWebhookEvent(payload: CalendlyWebhookPayload): Promise<MappedCalendlyBooking | null>;
   }
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Abstraction**: Create a config service that abstracts environment variables:
   ```typescript
   export const getConfig = () => ({
     calendly: {
       apiToken: process.env.CALENDLY_API_TOKEN || '',
       apiTokenSecondary: process.env.CALENDLY_API_TOKEN_SECONDARY || '',
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Test Utilities**: Create specific test utilities for Calendly API testing:
   ```typescript
   export const setupMockCalendlyAPI = () => {
     vi.mock('@/lib/scheduling/calendly/key-manager', ...);
     return {
       mockEventTypes: () => {...},
       mockSchedulingLink: () => {...},
       mockWebhook: () => {...}
     };
   };
   ```
