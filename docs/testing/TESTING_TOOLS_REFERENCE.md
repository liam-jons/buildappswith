# Testing Tools Reference for Buildappswith

This document outlines the testing tools available for the Buildappswith platform and how they are integrated into our testing strategy.

## Available Testing Tools

### Core Testing Tools

- **Vitest**: Primary test runner for unit, component, and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: Main utility for testing React components
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing framework for full user flow verification
- **Jest-axe**: Accessibility testing utility integrated with our component tests

### Additional Testing Platforms

- **Chromatic**: Visual regression testing and component documentation
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and monitoring for production issues
- **Datadog**: Test visualization, monitoring, and performance tracking
- **Stagehand**: Interactive testing and component demonstration
- **Postman**: API testing and documentation tool

## Integration Points

### Chromatic Integration

Used for:
- Visual regression testing of UI components
- Documentation of component states and variants
- Storybook integration for component development

### Sentry Integration

Used for:
- Error tracking in production and staging environments
- Performance monitoring for critical user paths
- Exception handling verification

### Datadog Integration

Used for:
- Test result visualization and trending
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking
- Test coverage tracking over time

### Stagehand Integration

Used for:
- Interactive component testing
- Testing component variants and states
- Component demonstration for stakeholders

### Postman Integration

Used for:
- API endpoint testing and validation
- API documentation
- Mock server for development

## Usage Guidelines

Each tool serves a specific purpose in our testing strategy:

1. **Unit and Component Testing**: Use Vitest and React Testing Library
2. **Integration Testing**: Use Vitest with component composition
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Use Playwright for critical user flows
4. **Visual Testing**: Use Chromatic for UI regression
5. **API Testing**: Use Postman for endpoint validation
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Use Datadog and Sentry
7. **Error Tracking**: Use Sentry for production error detection
8. **Interactive Testing**: Use Stagehand for manual verification

## Setting Up Testing Tools

Refer to the comprehensive testing framework documentation for detailed setup instructions for each tool:

- [Testing Framework Documentation](/docs/TESTING_FRAMEWORK_COMPREHENSIVE.md)
- [Datadog Integration](/docs/DATADOG_INTEGRATION.md)
- Specific tool documentation in `/docs/testing/`

## Best Practices

- Use the appropriate tool for each testing need
- Maintain consistent testing patterns across the codebase
- Leverage automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Use visual testing to complement automated tests
- Monitor error rates and performance in production
