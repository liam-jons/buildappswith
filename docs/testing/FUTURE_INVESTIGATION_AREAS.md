# Areas for Future Investigation

Based on our test failure analysis, this document outlines areas of the application that warrant further investigation. These issues don't necessarily indicate bugs but highlight parts of the system that might benefit from deeper review and more comprehensive testing.

## 1. Profile Form Validation

**Issue**: The profile form helper functions were missing entirely, suggesting potential gaps in profile validation.

**Investigation Areas:**
- Verify that production code implements proper validation that aligns with the test implementation
- Check for consistency between form requirements and validation logic
- Review error handling and user feedback in profile forms
- Ensure validation rules are documented and follow business requirements

**Impact**: Incomplete validation could allow invalid data submission, affecting user profiles and downstream features.

## 2. Error Handling in Stripe Integration

**Issue**: The mismatch between expected error types (`authorization_error` vs `unknown_error`) indicates inconsistency in error handling.

**Investigation Areas:**
- Review the error handling strategy across the Stripe payment flow
- Check for overly broad error catching that might mask specific issues
- Ensure errors are properly categorized, logged, and presented to users
- Verify that error states are recoverable in the payment flow

**Impact**: Poor error handling could make debugging payment issues difficult and create confusing experiences for users encountering payment problems.

## 3. Authentication Flow Edge Cases

**Issue**: Authentication tests needed significant restructuring, suggesting gaps in testing coverage.

**Investigation Areas:**
- Test edge cases like token expiration and refresh
- Verify handling of role changes and permission updates
- Test cross-device logins and session management
- Review authentication redirects and returnUrl handling

**Impact**: Untested authentication paths could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected user experiences during authentication flows.

## 4. Component Error Boundaries

**Issue**: Error boundary tests had mismatches with the actual component implementation.

**Investigation Areas:**
- Verify error recovery paths across critical components
- Ensure error states provide useful information to users
- Test integration with error reporting services (Sentry)
- Review error boundary nesting and component hierarchies

**Impact**: Poorly implemented error boundaries could result in cascading failures or blank screens instead of graceful degradation.

## 5. Test Infrastructure Maintenance

**Issue**: Directory mismatches and test configuration issues suggest inconsistent test infrastructure maintenance.

**Investigation Areas:**
- Align test directory structure with configuration expectations
- Document test organization and patterns for developers
- Implement pre-commit hooks to validate test structure
- Consider automating test organization with linting rules

**Impact**: Inconsistent test infrastructure can lead to false confidence in test results and make it harder to maintain tests alongside application changes.
