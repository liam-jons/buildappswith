  Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (Weeks 7-8)

  Goal: Integrate tests into development workflow for continuous validation.

  1. CI Pipeline Configuration
    - GitHub Actions workflow setup
    - Test parallelization and sharding
    - Reporting and notifications
  2. Environment-Specific Configurations
    - Development, staging, and production test setups
    - Environment-specific test data management
    - Shadow testing mode for production
  3. Monitoring and Maintenance
    - Test result dashboards
    - Flaky test detection
    - Test maintenance processes

  3. Priority Critical Path Tests

  The following tests represent the highest priority flows that must be validated on every code change:

  1. Complete Signup to Booking Flow
    - New user signup
    - Builder discovery and selection
    - Session type selection
    - Calendly scheduling
    - Payment processing
    - Booking confirmation
  2. Returning User Booking Flow
    - Authenticated user login
    - Direct builder profile access
    - Session booking
    - Payment processing
  3. Marketplace Discovery Flow
    - Browse marketplace
    - Filter by expertise
    - Sort and refine results
    - View builder profiles
  4. Payment Processing Flow
    - Various payment methods
    - Handling declined payments
    - 3D Secure authentication
    - Receipt verification

  4. Implementation Guidelines

  Test Data Strategy

  - Isolation: Each test creates and manages its own data
  - Cleanup: All test data is removed after test completion
  - Identification: Test data uses clear prefixes and metadata
  - Production Safety: Special protections for production environment tests

  Visual Verification Approach

  - Component Checks: Verify critical UI components visually
  - Layout Verification: Ensure responsive layouts work across devices
  - Content Validation: Confirm important content is displayed correctly
  - Accessibility: Verify accessibility features are properly implemented

  Authentication Testing

  - Clerk Integration: Support for testing with real Clerk authentication
  - User Roles: Tests for all user types (Client, Builder, Admin)
  - State Management: Proper authentication state handling
  - Role Switching: Tests for multi-role user scenarios

  Calendly & Stripe Integration

  - Iframe Handling: Reliable interaction with third-party iframes
  - Webhook Processing: Comprehensive webhook testing
  - Error Scenarios: Testing of failure conditions and recovery
  - End-to-End Validation: Complete flow verification

  5. Resource Requirements

  1. Environment Setup
    - Test accounts for all services (Clerk, Calendly, Stripe)
    - API keys and webhook secrets
    - Database access for test data management
  2. Infrastructure
    - CI/CD pipeline configuration
    - Stagehand API access and configuration
    - Test reporting and monitoring tools
  3. Development Resources
    - Initial framework implementation: 1-2 developers for 4 weeks
    - Test implementation: 1 developer for 4-6 weeks
    - Ongoing maintenance: 2-4 hours per week

  6. Success Metrics

  1. Test Coverage
    - 100% coverage of critical revenue-impacting flows
    - 90% coverage of key user journeys
    - Visual verification of all primary UI components
  2. Test Reliability
    - <5% flaky test rate
    - <2% false positives
    - <1% false negatives for critical issues
  3. Development Impact
    - <15 minute run time for critical path tests in CI
    - <1 hour for full test suite
    - Zero production regressions in tested flows

  7. Implementation Timeline

  Week 1-2:   Foundation setup
  Week 3-4:   Critical business flow tests
  Week 5-6:   Advanced testing capabilities
  Week 7-8:   CI/CD integration
  Week 9-10:  Refinement and optimization
  Week 11-12: Documentation and training

  8. Maintenance Plan

  1. Regular Reviews
    - Weekly test success rate review
    - Bi-weekly test maintenance sessions
    - Monthly comprehensive test coverage review
  2. Update Processes
    - Test updates with each significant UI change
    - Regular updates for third-party integration changes
    - Quarterly framework version updates
  3. Documentation
    - Maintain up-to-date framework documentation
    - Clear processes for adding new tests
    - Troubleshooting guides for common issues

  9. Risk Assessment

  1. High Impact Risks
    - Stagehand AI reliability for complex UI interactions
    - Third-party service changes (Calendly, Stripe)
    - Test data isolation failures
  2. Mitigation Strategies
    - Implement fallback mechanisms for AI interactions
    - Regular monitoring of third-party integration changes
    - Strong test data isolation and verification
  3. Contingency Plan
    - Manual testing fallback procedures
    - Emergency test fixes process
    - Escalation path for critical test failures

  10. Next Steps

  1. Prepare development environment with Stagehand configuration
  2. Implement core framework components and test utilities
  3. Create initial signup-to-payment test flow
  4. Configure CI pipeline for test automation
  5. Roll out tests to development workflow
