# Liam's Profile Production Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Liam's profile in the production environment, including the expertise areas, session types, and Clerk integration.

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Created SQL migrations for production schema
- Created User record for Liam with proper Clerk ID
- Created BuilderProfile with expertise fields
- Added JSON expertise areas with testimonials
- Added portfolio items and social links
- Created SessionType records for booking

## Migration Scripts Created

1. **Schema Migration**: 
   - `prisma/migrations/add_clerk_id_production.sql`
   - `prisma/migrations/add_session_types_production.sql`

2. **Profile Creation/Update**:
   - `scripts/seed-data/update-liam-prod-fixed.js`

3. **Runner Script**:
   - `scripts/seed-data/run-liam-prod-final.sh`

4. **Verification**:
   - `scripts/verify-profile-simple.sql`

## Schema Differences Found (Dev vs Production)

During implementation, we discovered several differences between development and production schemas:

1. **User Table Differences**:
   - Production has a single `role` enum field instead of an array of roles (`UserRole[]`)
   - Production does not have `isFounder` field
   - Production does not have `imageUrl` field
   - Production does not have `active` or `deletedAt` fields

2. **Table Existence**:
   - `SessionType` table did not exist in production

## How to Run the Migration

To apply the complete migration to the production environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd /path/to/buildappswith

# Set the production database URL if not already in environment
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://Buildappswith-prod_owner:npg_gx5DNL4uHChw@ep-purple-paper-ab51kphc-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/Buildappswith-prod?sslmode=require"

# Run the migration script
TARGET_PROD=true ./scripts/seed-data/run-liam-prod-final.sh
```

## Verification

To verify that Liam's profile has been properly set up in production:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd /path/to/buildappswith

# Set the production database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://Buildappswith-prod_owner:npg_gx5DNL4uHChw@ep-purple-paper-ab51kphc-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/Buildappswith-prod?sslmode=require"

# Run verification SQL
npx prisma db execute --file scripts/verify-profile-simple.sql --schema prisma/schema.prisma
```
