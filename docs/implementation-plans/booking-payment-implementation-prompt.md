## Implementation Background

The buildappswith platform has a well-designed architecture for handling booking and payment processes. However, the current implementation is incomplete, with missing components for both the scheduling service and the payment integration. We need to implement the missing pieces to enable a complete end-to-end booking-to-payment flow.

The platform uses:
- Next.js App Router for routing and server components
- Clerk for authentication
- Prisma for database operations
- Stripe for payment processing

We already have working UI components for booking (components/scheduling/*) and payment (components/payment/*), but the server-side implementation and integration are incomplete.

## Implementation Objectives

1. Implement Scheduling Service:
   - Create the missing `lib/scheduling/real-data/scheduling-service.ts` file that handles booking operations
   - Implement functions for managing bookings, availability, and time slots
   - Connect the service to the Prisma database

2. Implement Stripe Payment Server Actions:
   - Complete the server actions in `lib/stripe/actions.ts`
   - Create the checkout session creation logic
   - Implement webhook handling for payment events

3. Create Checkout API Route:
   - Implement the missing `/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`
   - Connect it to the Stripe server actions
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization

4. Implement Booking Confirmation UI:
   - Create the booking confirmation page
   - Handle payment status and display booking details
   - Provide user feedback for successful/failed payments

5. Create Comprehensive Tests:
   - Write unit tests for the scheduling service
   - Test the Stripe integration with mock payments
   - Create end-to-end tests for the complete flow

## Important Constraints

1. Use existing Stripe features whenever possible - don't reinvent functionality that Stripe already provides.
2. Maintain type safety throughout the implementation.
3. Ensure proper error handling for all operations.
4. Follow the established architectural patterns in the codebase.
5. Make sure all database operations are properly secured with authentication checks.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation should follow this sequence:

1. Start with the scheduling service, as it's the foundation for the booking operations.
2. Implement the server actions for both scheduling and payment.
3. Create the checkout API route to handle payment initiation.
4. Implement the confirmation UI to handle post-payment flows.
5. Add comprehensive tests for all components.

## Expected Outputs

1. Complete implementation of the scheduling service with database integration.
2. Functioning server actions for booking and payment operations.
3. Working checkout API route for initiating Stripe payments.
4. Booking confirmation UI for handling payment results.
5. Comprehensive test suite for the entire flow.

The implementation should enable users to select a session type, choose a time slot, provide their details, and complete payment through Stripe, with proper feedback and confirmation throughout the process.
