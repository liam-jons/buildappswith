# Calendly Integration with Booking-to-Payment Flow Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Calendly with our booking-to-payment flow. This integration will leverage Calendly's robust scheduling infrastructure which is already integrated with Liam's Outlook calendar and Zoom account, while connecting seamlessly to our existing Stripe payment processing.

## Architecture Overview

The integration will follow this high-level flow:

```
┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

1. **Get Calendly Event Types**
   ```
   GET /api/scheduling/calendly/event-types
   ```

2. **Get Calendly Event URL**
   ```
   POST /api/scheduling/calendly/scheduling-link
   ```

3. **Create Booking from Calendly Event**
   ```
   POST /api/scheduling/calendly/booking
   ```

4. **Calendly Webhook Handler**
   ```
   POST /api/webhooks/calendly
   ```

### Authentication Strategy

Phase 1 will use a Personal Access Token for Liam's Calendly account. In the future, we'll implement OAuth 2.0 to support multiple builders with their own Calendly accounts.

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
ALTER TABLE "SessionType" ADD COLUMN "calendlyEventTypeId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "SessionType" ADD COLUMN "calendlyEventTypeUri" TEXT;

ALTER TABLE "Booking" ADD COLUMN "calendlyEventId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "Booking" ADD COLUMN "calendlyEventUri" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "Booking" ADD COLUMN "calendlyInviteeUri" TEXT;
```

### State Management

The booking flow will be managed using a state machine approach with well-defined states:

- INITIATED -> SCHEDULED -> PAYMENT_PENDING -> CONFIRMED -> COMPLETED
- With possible error states: ABANDONED, CANCELED, PAYMENT_FAILED, REFUNDED

### Webhook Processing

We'll handle the following Calendly webhook events:
- `invitee.created`: When someone schedules a meeting
- `invitee.canceled`: When someone cancels a meeting
- `invitee.rescheduled`: When someone reschedules a meeting

### Security Considerations

- Environment variable management for API keys
- Encryption for OAuth refresh tokens
- Key rotation and monitoring
- Webhook signature verification

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to integrating Calendly with our booking-to-payment flow. The phased approach ensures we can deliver incremental value while managing complexity and dependencies.
