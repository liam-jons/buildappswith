## Component Background

This planning session addresses the core user experience components of the BuildAppsWith platform: user profiles and role-specific dashboards. The platform currently supports multiple user roles (Builder, Client, Admin) with distinct profiles and dashboards for each role. This architecture allows users to maintain separate identities within the platform while providing tailored experiences based on their roles.

The profile system is designed to store and display user information, skills, portfolio items, and availability, while dashboards serve as functional hubs for each role. Builder dashboards should display booking requests, profile visibility metrics, and portfolio management tools. Client dashboards should show booked sessions, project progress, and builder recommendations.

The current implementation has a working authentication system through Clerk, but we've identified issues with the full profile flow and dashboard-to-profile connectivity. There are also opportunities to improve the role-specific dashboard experiences to better reflect the unique needs of builders and clients.

This planning session will focus on understanding the current state of profiles and dashboards, identifying gaps, and planning the necessary improvements to create a cohesive user experience aligned with the MVP requirements.

## Planning Objectives

- Audit the current Builder and Client profile implementations
- Review the dashboard components for each user role
- Map the connections between authentication, profiles, and dashboards
- Identify gaps in the current implementation compared to MVP requirements
- Assess profile data structures and database schema for completeness
- Analyze the portfolio/project management capabilities for Builders
- Evaluate booking display and management for both Builders and Clients
- Define the role-specific metrics and displays needed for each dashboard
- Determine the necessary server actions and API routes for profile management
- Plan improvements to create a cohesive, role-appropriate user experience
- Prioritize implementation tasks for meeting MVP requirements

   - State management approach for role-specific dashboards
   - Data fetching strategy for profile and dashboard information
   - Error handling patterns for profile operations

5. **Implementation Roadmap**:
   - High-priority items for immediate implementation
   - Medium-priority enhancements for improved user experience
   - Long-term recommendations for post-MVP improvements

## Research Focus Areas

- **User Role Management**: How roles are assigned, stored, and used for conditional rendering
- **Profile Data Structure**: The relationship between User, BuilderProfile, and ClientProfile models
- **Dashboard Architecture**: Component organization and data flow in role-specific dashboards
- **Portfolio Management**: Builder portfolio item storage, display, and management
- **Session Booking**: Integration of booking functionality with user profiles
- **Profile Metrics**: Analytics and statistics displayed to users based on their role
- **State Management**: How user state, profile data, and dashboard information are managed
- **Server Actions**: Implementation of profile management functionality with server actions
- **Multi-role Support**: How the platform handles users with multiple roles

## Implementation Considerations

- **Performance**: Efficient loading of profile and dashboard data
- **Scalability**: Supporting users with multiple roles and profiles
- **Security**: Proper access control for profile data and management functions
- **Usability**: Intuitive navigation between profile and dashboard views
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns in profile and dashboard code
- **Testing**: Strategies for testing profile management and dashboard functionality
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of profile data loading and update failures
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring dashboards and profiles are accessible to all users
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adapting profile and dashboard views for mobile devices
