# Database Updates Summary

## Date: May 15, 2025

## Schema Changes Applied

Using the database-first approach with `prisma db push`, we successfully applied the following schema changes to both development and production databases:

### 1. ClientProfile Updates
- Added `pathways` field (JSON) - Default: "[]"
  - Stores pathway tracking information for clients
  - Structure: Array of pathway objects with name, status, progress, etc.

### 2. Booking Enhancements
- Added `pathway` field (String, nullable)
  - Links bookings to specific pathways
- Added `customQuestionResponse` field (JSON, nullable)
  - Stores custom question responses from Calendly forms

### 3. SessionType Enhancements
- Added `requiresAuth` field (Boolean) - Default: true
  - Determines if authentication is required for session type
- Added `displayOrder` field (Int) - Default: 999
  - Controls the display order of session types
- Added `eventTypeCategory` field (String, nullable)
  - Categorizes sessions as 'free', 'pathway', or 'specialized'

### 4. Skill Enhancements
- Added `isFundamental` field (Boolean) - Default: false
  - Marks skills that appear across multiple pathways
- Added `pathways` field (String[]) - Default: []
  - Lists which pathways include this skill

### 5. New Model: UserSkillProgress
- Tracks user progress through skills
- Fields include:
  - `userId`, `skillId` - Foreign keys
  - `status` - NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED
  - `completedAt`, `completedVia`, `validatedBy`
  - `pathway` - Which pathway context
  - `notes`, `attempts`, `lastAttemptAt`
- Includes appropriate indexes and unique constraints

### 6. User Model Update
- Added `skillProgress` relation to UserSkillProgress[]

### 7. Skill Model Update
- Added `userProgress` relation to UserSkillProgress[]

### 8. New Enums
- `ProgressStatus`: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED
- `CompletionMethod`: ASSESSMENT, BUILDER_VALIDATION, AUTO, MANUAL

## Cleanup Actions Taken

1. Removed duplicate clerk_id migrations:
   - `20250424122301_add_clerk_id`
   - `20250424_add_clerk_id`

2. Used `prisma db push` instead of migrations to avoid conflicts

## Calendly Configuration

No immediate actions required in the Calendly dashboard. The system will:
- Use existing event types
- Categorize them based on naming conventions
- Map them to SessionType records via the sync endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Test the Calendly sync endpoint with existing event types
2. Update the booking flow UI to use new fields
3. Implement pathway selection in booking process
4. Test authentication-based session filtering
5. Deploy API changes to production

## Commands Used

```bash
# Development database update
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Production database update
DATABASE_URL="[prod-url]" npx prisma db push
```

## Verification

All changes have been successfully applied to both development and production databases. The schema is now ready to support the pathway-based booking system.
