# Payment Processing in Buildappswith

*Version: 1.0.110*

This document provides an overview of the payment processing implementation in the Buildappswith platform, focusing on the integration with Stripe.

## Overview

Buildappswith uses Stripe for processing payments, particularly for booking sessions with builders. The implementation follows a security-first approach with robust error handling and comprehensive logging.

## Architecture

The payment processing architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Stripe Server Utility**: Central configuration and helpers (`lib/stripe/stripe-server.ts`)
2. **Stripe Client Utility**: Browser-side integration utilities (`lib/stripe/stripe-client.ts`)
3. **Checkout API Route**: Handles creation of payment sessions (`app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`)
4. **Webhook API Route**: Processes Stripe events (`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)
5. **Database Integration**: Records payment status in booking records

## Payment Flow

### Checkout Flow

1. Client initiates booking with builder through frontend
2. Client-side code calls the checkout API route with booking details
3. Server verifies authentication and validates booking data
4. Server creates/updates booking record in "PENDING" state
5. Server creates Stripe checkout session with booking metadata
6. Server returns session ID and redirect URL to client
7. Client redirects to Stripe Checkout
8. User completes payment on Stripe-hosted page
9. Stripe redirects user back to success/cancel URL

### Webhook Flow

1. Stripe sends event to webhook endpoint when payment status changes
2. Server verifies webhook signature
3. Server processes event based on event type
4. For successful payments, server updates booking status to "CONFIRMED"
5. For failed payments, server updates booking status accordingly
6. Server returns acknowledgment to Stripe

## Security Measures

The payment implementation includes several security measures:

1. **Signature Verification**: All webhook events are verified using Stripe signatures
2. **Authentication Check**: All checkout requests require authenticated users
3. **User Validation**: Ensures the authenticated user matches the clientId in booking
4. **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging of payment events for audit trails
5. **Error Classification**: Detailed error categorization for proper handling

## Error Handling

The API routes implement consistent error handling with:

1. **Structured Responses**: All responses follow the `ApiResponse` format
2. **HTTP Status Codes**: Appropriate status codes for different error types
3. **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear error messages for debugging
4. **Logging**: All errors are logged with context for troubleshooting

## Testing

The payment implementation is thoroughly tested with:

1. **Checkout Tests**: Authentication, validation, database integration, error handling
2. **Webhook Tests**: Signature verification, event processing, error handling
3. **Mock Implementation**: Proper mocking of Stripe, Prisma, and authentication

## Local Development

For local testing of the Stripe integration:

1. Use Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local environment
2. Use test API keys configured in `.env.local`
3. Use the test card information from Stripe documentation
4. Monitor webhook events in the Stripe CLI output

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. Use live API keys secured in environment variables
2. Set up proper webhook endpoints in the Stripe dashboard
3. Implement monitoring and alerting for payment failures
4. Configure proper error notifications for payment issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the payment system include:

1. Idempotency keys for checkout sessions
2. Retry mechanisms for database operations
3. Email notifications for payment events
4. Enhanced analytics for payment conversion
5. Subscription billing support (recurring payments)
