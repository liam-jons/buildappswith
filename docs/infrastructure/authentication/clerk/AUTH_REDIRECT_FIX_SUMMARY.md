# Authentication Redirect and Dashboard Routes Fix Summary

## Date: May 15, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Calendly Integration Database Sync
- **Problem**: Session types were duplicated in dev and missing URIs in prod
- **Root Cause**: Script accidentally updated dev database twice instead of once for each environment
- **Solution**: Created new script `update-prod-session-types.js` that properly updates production
- **Result**: Both databases now have aligned session types with proper Calendly URIs

### 2. Dashboard 404 Errors
- **Problem**: Multiple routes returning 404 errors:
  - `/bookings`
  - `/client-dashboard`  
  - `/builder-profile`
- **Root Cause**: Platform header referenced non-existent routes
- **Solution**: Updated platform header to use correct routes:
  - `/dashboard` - Role-based unified dashboard
  - `/profile` - User's own profile
  - `/marketplace/builders/[id]` - Public builder profiles
- **Result**: All navigation links now point to valid routes

### 3. Authentication Redirect Issues
- **Problem**: Users redirected to landing page after sign-in instead of intended destination
- **Root Cause**: Sign-in/sign-up pages weren't properly handling redirect parameters
- **Solution**: Updated auth pages to:
  - Check multiple redirect parameter names
  - Use `afterSignInUrl` and `afterSignUpUrl` properties
  - Default to `/dashboard` after authentication
- **Result**: Users now redirected to correct destination after authentication

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **scripts/update-prod-session-types.js**
   - New script to properly update production session types
   - Deletes existing types and recreates with Calendly URIs
   - Uses GBP currency for UK market

2. **components/platform/platform-header.tsx**
   - Updated `getUserMenuItems` function to use correct routes
   - Added user ID parameter for dynamic builder profile links
   - Removed references to non-existent routes

3. **app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx**
   - Added support for multiple redirect parameter names
   - Implemented `afterSignInUrl` for proper post-auth routing
   - Default redirect to `/dashboard`

4. **app/(auth)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx**
   - Same updates as sign-in page for consistency
   - Proper redirect handling after registration

### Route Architecture Clarification

**Current Valid Routes:**
- `/dashboard` - Unified dashboard showing role-specific content
- `/profile` - User's own profile management
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (for admin users)
- `/marketplace` - Public marketplace listing
- `/marketplace/builders/[id]` - Individual builder profiles

**Removed/Invalid Routes:**
- `/bookings` - Now integrated into dashboard
- `/client-dashboard` - Replaced by role-based `/dashboard`
- `/builder-profile` - Use `/profile` for own profile or marketplace routes

## Verification

Created `scripts/verify-auth-routes.js` to validate:
- All required routes exist
- Old routes have been removed
- Platform header uses correct links
- Auth pages handle redirects properly

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete authentication flow in production
2. Verify Calendly embedding works with updated session types
3. Monitor for any remaining 404 errors
4. Update any documentation referencing old routes
5. Consider implementing route aliases for backwards compatibility if needed

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Update production session types
DATABASE_URL="[production-url]" node scripts/update-prod-session-types.js

# Verify routes are configured correctly  
node scripts/verify-auth-routes.js

# Check session types in both environments
node scripts/check-session-types.js
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Always verify which database environment scripts are targeting
2. Route structure should match component references
3. Authentication redirects require handling multiple parameter formats
4. Role-based dashboards consolidate into single route with conditional rendering
