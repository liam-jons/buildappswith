# The C4 Model for Software Architecture

This document provides an overview of the C4 model and how we use it to document the Buildappswith platform architecture.

## What is the C4 Model?

The C4 model was created by Simon Brown as a way to create software architecture diagrams that are clear, consistent, and easy to communicate. C4 stands for Context, Containers, Components, and Code—the four levels of abstraction in the model.

## The Four C's

### Level 1: System Context Diagram

The System Context diagram shows the software system in question and how it relates to users (people) and other software systems. It's a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system, allowing you to step back and see the big picture.

**Key elements:**
- The software system in scope
- Users of the system (people)
- External systems the software system interacts with

### Level 2: Container Diagram

The Container diagram zooms into the software system and shows the high-level technical building blocks (containers). A container represents an application or a data store—something that needs to be running for the overall system to work.

**Key elements:**
- Web applications
- Mobile apps
- Desktop applications
- Microservices
- Database management systems
- File systems
- Message buses

### Level 3: Component Diagram

The Component diagram zooms into an individual container to show the components inside it. These components are grouped implementations of functionality, often aligned with architectural layers or domain concepts.

**Key elements:**
- Groups of related functionality
- Domain-specific modules
- Architectural layers
- APIs

### Level 4: Code Diagram

The Code diagram zooms into a component to show how it is implemented, using UML class diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, or similar. This level is optional and often only used for the most complex or critical parts of the system.

## Why We Use the C4 Model

1. **Standardized Approach**: Provides a common language for describing software architecture
2. **Multiple Levels of Detail**: Supports different audiences and conversations
3. **Simple Notation**: Focuses on the structure rather than complex notation
4. **Flexible Implementation**: Can be implemented with various tools
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Designed to be useful for software developers

## How We Implement C4 with Structurizr

We use Structurizr DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define our C4 model. This approach:

1. Allows version control of architecture alongside code
2. Provides a textual representation that's easy to review
3. Generates consistent diagrams from a single source of truth
4. Supports automatic layout and styling

## Buildappswith C4 Model Structure

Our model is organized as follows:

- **System Context**: Shows Buildappswith and its relationships with users and external systems
- **Containers**: Depicts the key technical components of the platform (frontend, API, database, etc.)
- **Components**: Details the internal structure of key containers (ongoing development)
- **Code**: Links to source code where appropriate (used selectively)

## Working with the C4 Model

When developing new features or making architectural changes, consider:

1. Does this change affect how users interact with the system? (Context level)
2. Does this change introduce new containers or modify existing ones? (Container level)
3. Does this change the internal component structure of a container? (Component level)
4. Does this change require detailed code-level documentation? (Code level)

Update the appropriate level(s) of the C4 model to reflect your changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on the essential structure rather than implementation details
2. **Consistency**: Use consistent naming and relationships across diagrams
3. **Meaningful Abstractions**: Ensure each element represents a meaningful concept
4. **Appropriate Detail**: Include only the detail necessary for the audience
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep diagrams in sync with implementation
