# 1. Use Structurizr for Architecture Documentation

Date: 2025-04-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Buildappswith platform grows in complexity, we need a systematic way to document and communicate its architecture. This is particularly important before implementing significant changes like the planned migration from NextAuth to Clerk.

We need an architecture documentation approach that:
- Can be version-controlled alongside the codebase
- Follows established best practices for architecture representation
- Provides multiple views and levels of detail
- Is maintainable over time by developers
- Supports visualization and sharing of architecture information

## Decision

We will use Structurizr with the C4 model for architecture documentation. Specifically:

1. We will use Structurizr Lite as a local development tool for creating and viewing architecture diagrams.
2. We will use the Structurizr DSL (Domain Specific Language) approach to define our architecture.
3. We will follow the C4 model (Context, Containers, Components, Code) to organize our architectural views.
4. We will store the DSL files in the project repository under docs/architecture/structurizr.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Architecture documentation will be versioned alongside code changes.
- The C4 model provides a standardized approach to architectural representation.
- The DSL approach makes architecture documentation accessible to all developers.
- We can generate multiple views of the architecture from a single model.
- Structurizr Lite is free and open-source, requiring no additional licensing costs.

### Negative

- Team members will need to learn the Structurizr DSL syntax.
- Running Structurizr Lite requires Docker, adding a development dependency.
- Keeping the architecture documentation in sync with implementation will require discipline.

### Neutral

- We may consider adopting Structurizr Cloud or On-premises versions in the future if team needs evolve.
- Integration with CI/CD for automated diagram generation will be considered as a future enhancement.
