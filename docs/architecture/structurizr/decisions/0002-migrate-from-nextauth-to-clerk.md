# 2. Migrate from NextAuth to Clerk

Date: 2025-04-26

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The current implementation uses NextAuth.js for authentication. While functional, we've identified several challenges:

1. **Implementation Inconsistencies**: The codebase has inconsistent authentication implementation patterns.
2. **User Management Limitations**: NextAuth lacks comprehensive user management features out of the box.
3. **Role Management Complexity**: Current role-based access control is custom-built and maintenance-intensive.
4. **Multi-tenancy Support**: As we plan for organizational accounts, we need better multi-tenancy support.
5. **Authentication UX**: The current authentication flows could be improved for a better user experience.

After reviewing several authentication providers, Clerk has emerged as a promising alternative that addresses these challenges.

## Decision

We will migrate from NextAuth.js to Clerk as our authentication provider. This migration will be done in phases:

1. **Architectural Documentation**: Create detailed documentation of current and future auth flows using Structurizr
2. **Parallel Implementation**: Implement Clerk alongside NextAuth temporarily
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move authentication flows one by one to Clerk
4. **User Migration**: Migrate existing users to Clerk
5. **NextAuth Removal**: Remove NextAuth once migration is complete

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved user management with built-in features
- Streamlined role-based access control
- Better multi-tenancy support for organizational accounts
- Enhanced authentication UX with customizable flows
- Reduced custom authentication code to maintain
- Better security with specialized authentication provider

### Negative

- Migration effort required for existing users
- Learning curve for the team to work with Clerk
- Temporary complexity during the migration period
- Potential for regression issues during the transition

### Neutral

- External dependency on Clerk as a service
- Associated costs with Clerk subscription
- Need to update documentation and training materials

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. Document current authentication architecture using Structurizr
2. Create a detailed migration plan with rollback strategies
3. Set up Clerk in development environment
4. Implement parallel authentication systems
5. Gradually migrate features
6. Test extensively in staging environment
7. Execute user migration with careful monitoring
8. Remove NextAuth components once migration is complete
