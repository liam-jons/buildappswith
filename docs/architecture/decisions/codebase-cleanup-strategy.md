# Codebase Cleanup Strategy

**Date**: 2025-04-28
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

The codebase has accumulated a significant number of unused components (43% of total components according to analysis reports). This technical debt needs to be addressed before launch to improve maintainability and performance.

## Decision

We will implement a phased cleanup approach:

1. **Phase 1**: UI Components (current)
   - Focus on visual elements first as they're less likely to have subtle dependencies
   - Prioritize components with Magic UI or custom styling elements

2. **Phase 2**: Pages and Routes
   - Address unused page components after UI components are cleaned up
   - Verify through both static analysis and runtime checks

3. **Phase 3**: API Routes
   - Address unused API endpoints last due to potential hidden dependencies
   - Implement careful validation before removal

## Selection Criteria

For identifying removal candidates:
1. No incoming references in the codebase
2. Not part of the core functionality (booking, marketplace, authentication)
3. Last modified dates indicating they weren't recently updated

## Backup Strategy

All removed components will be:
1. Backed up in structured directories under `docs/cleanup-records/`
2. Documented in removal record files with rationale
3. Incrementally versioned in the backup path with dates

## Validation Process

1. Use architecture analysis tools to identify candidates
2. Perform multi-method verification (import search, string reference search)
3. Create backups before removal
4. Test functionality after removal
5. Document in changelog

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Reduced codebase complexity, improved maintainability, better performance
- **Negative**: Potential risk of removing components that have non-obvious dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Careful validation, backups, and version control allow for easy restoration if needed
