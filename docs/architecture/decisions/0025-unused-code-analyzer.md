# 25. Unused Code Analyzer Implementation

Date: 2025-04-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the Buildappswith platform has evolved, certain features like the AI timeline may be deprecated or replaced with alternative approaches. Additionally, the architecture may have grown more complex than necessary for the current requirements. We need a systematic approach to identify components that are no longer needed and find opportunities to simplify the overall architecture.

The existing architecture extraction tools provide a good foundation for this analysis, but they primarily focus on documenting the current state rather than identifying potential improvements.

## Decision

We have implemented a comprehensive "Unused Code Analyzer" that builds upon the existing architecture extraction tools. This analyzer:

1. **Identifies Potentially Unused Components**:
   - Analyzes the dependency graph to find components with no incoming references
   - Examines import statements across the codebase
   - Identifies "orphaned" pages and routes that are not linked from navigation

2. **Provides Architectural Complexity Metrics**:
   - Component complexity scores based on dependencies, size, and type
   - Container coupling measurements
   - Identification of cyclic dependencies
   - Pattern inconsistency detection

3. **Generates Actionable Reports**:
   - Markdown and HTML reports for both unused components and architectural complexity
   - Mermaid diagrams for visual analysis
   - Specific focus on the AI Timeline feature
   - Concrete recommendations for simplification

## Technical Implementation

The analyzer consists of two primary scripts:

1. `scripts/create-unused-features-analyzer.ts`: The main analysis logic that:
   - Builds on existing architecture extraction tools
   - Uses TS-Morph for code structure analysis
   - Calculates metrics for component usage and complexity
   - Generates comprehensive reports

2. `scripts/run-unused-code-analyzer.sh`: A runner script that:
   - Ensures consistent timestamps across generated files
   - Runs the architecture extraction first for up-to-date data
   - Executes the analysis
   - Provides a convenient summary of results

The tools are integrated into the npm scripts as `arch:unused` for easy execution.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Provides data-driven insights for codebase cleanup decisions
- Establishes objective metrics for architectural complexity
- Creates a baseline for measuring improvement over time
- Supports targeted cleanup efforts, starting with the AI Timeline feature
- Integrates with existing architecture documentation processes

### Negative

- May produce false positives for components that are dynamically imported
- Analysis depends on the accuracy of the architecture extraction tools
- Recommendations still require human judgment to implement
- Regular execution is necessary to keep insights up-to-date

### Mitigations

- The tool clearly labels results as "potentially unused" to indicate uncertainty
- Reports provide context to help developers evaluate recommendations
- The HTML reports make it easy to explore and verify findings
- The implementation tracks both incoming and outgoing references to reduce false positives

## Future Work

- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline to track architectural metrics over time
- Enhance the analysis with code usage data from runtime monitoring
- Develop semi-automated cleanup scripts based on analysis results
- Add visualization tools for architectural complexity trends
