# 24. Daily Changelog Structure

Date: 2025-04-27  
Status: Accepted  
Deciders: Liam Jons, Claude  
Technical Story: Improve changelog organization for rapid development

## Context and Problem Statement

The Buildappswith project is evolving rapidly with multiple changes being made each day. The current approach of keeping all changes in a single CHANGELOG.md file is becoming unwieldy and difficult to navigate. Additionally, architecture extraction utilities need to recognize recently updated components to avoid incorrectly flagging them as technical debt.

## Decision Drivers

* Maintainability: Making the changelog easier to maintain and navigate
* Clarity: Providing a clear history of changes by date
* Scalability: Supporting a high volume of changes
* Architecture Visibility: Ensuring recently updated components are properly recognized

## Considered Options

1. Continue with a single monolithic CHANGELOG.md file
2. Split changelog by feature area (e.g., authentication, booking, etc.)
3. Split changelog by day with a main file linking to daily changelog files
4. Move to a fully automated changelog generation tool

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Split changelog by day with a main file linking to daily changelog files" because it provides a clear organization by date while maintaining the existing structure for recent changes.

### Implementation Details

1. **Main CHANGELOG.md Structure**
   - Contains only the most recent day's changes
   - Includes a "Unreleased" section for upcoming changes
   - Links to both daily changelog files and the archive

2. **Daily Changelog Files**
   - Named with format `CHANGELOG_DAILY_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Contains all changes made on a specific date
   - Includes a clear header indicating the date

3. **Version Tracking in Architecture Utilities**
   - Architecture extraction utilities updated to recognize the latest version
   - Each newly modernized component includes a version number comment
   - Version check in `architecture-utils.ts` updated with each release

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved readability with a focus on recent changes
* Better organization of changes by date
* Simplified process for finding changes made on a specific date
* Reduced likelihood of merge conflicts in the changelog
* Clearer architecture extraction with proper recognition of updated components

### Negative

* Slightly more complex file structure
* Need to keep version checks in architecture-utils.ts updated
* Additional overhead of creating new daily files

### Neutral

* No change to the content structure within changelog entries
* No impact on existing archives
