# 23. Stripe API Routes Architecture

Date: 2025-04-26  
Status: Accepted  
Deciders: Liam Jons, Claude  
Technical Story: Resolve technical debt in Stripe API routes

## Context and Problem Statement

The Stripe API routes in the Buildappswith platform were identified as having technical debt that could potentially impact revenue. The implementation lacked proper error handling, had inconsistent initialization, and was missing database integration and comprehensive testing.

## Decision Drivers

* Revenue impact: Payment processing is critical to business operations
* Security: Financial transactions require robust security measures
* Maintainability: Code structure should be clean and consistent
* Observability: Payment flows must be properly logged and monitored
* Testability: Critical payment paths must have comprehensive test coverage

## Considered Options

1. Minimal fixes to address only the most critical issues
2. Complete rewrite using a third-party Stripe library
3. Targeted refactoring with enhanced utilities and proper testing
4. Implementation of a full-featured payment service abstraction layer

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Targeted refactoring with enhanced utilities and proper testing" because it offers the best balance of addressing immediate concerns while setting up a maintainable structure for the future.

### Specific Architectural Decisions

1. **Centralized Stripe Configuration**
   - Single initialization point in `stripe-server.ts`
   - Consistent API version across all usages
   - Proper application information for Stripe logging

2. **Structured Error Handling**
   - Consistent `ApiResponse` type for all responses
   - HTTP status codes aligned with error types
   - Detailed error classification

3. **Database Integration Pattern**
   - Direct Prisma client usage in API routes
   - Transaction-based operations for data consistency
   - Clear separation between database and Stripe operations

4. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Structured logging with severity levels
   - Context-rich log entries with metadata
   - Correlation between related operations

5. **Testing Approach**
   - Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies
   - Full coverage of happy paths and error scenarios
   - Authentication and authorization test cases

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved reliability of payment processing
* Better diagnostics for troubleshooting payment issues
* Reduced risk of security vulnerabilities
* Increased confidence through test coverage
* Clearer code structure for future maintenance

### Negative

* Increased complexity compared to the original implementation
* More dependencies between components
* Higher maintenance overhead for tests

### Neutral

* No change to the external API contract
* No change to the user experience

## Implementation Notes

1. Stripe initialization and event handling is centralized in `stripe-server.ts`
2. All API routes use a consistent error response format
3. Authentication verification occurs before any payment processing
4. Database operations are properly integrated with error handling
5. Webhook security is enhanced with proper signature verification
