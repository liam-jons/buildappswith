# API Routes Cleanup - Phase 3

*Generated on: 2025-04-27*

## Overview

This document records the API routes removed during Phase 3 of the Buildappswith codebase cleanup. The cleanup focuses on removing unused, redundant, and test API routes to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.

## Categories of Routes Removed

The API routes were organized into four categories for systematic cleanup:

### 1. Development/Test Routes

These routes were created for development and testing purposes and have no production use:

| Route | Purpose | Reason for Removal |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `/api/sentry-example-api/route.ts` | Test route for Sentry integration | Development/testing only |
| `/api/dev/create-liam-profile/route.ts` | Dev utility to create prototype builder profile | Development only, protected from production use |
| `/api/dev/login/route.ts` | Development authentication utility | Redundant after Clerk migration |
| `/api/dev/seed-users/route.ts` | Development database seeding | Should be run via CLI, not API |
| `/api/test/auth/route.ts` | Test authentication system | Created specifically for testing |

### 2. Duplicate/Redundant API Routes

These routes provide functionality that is already available through other API routes:

| Route | Duplicate Of | Reason for Removal |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/api/scheduling/availability/rules/route.ts` | `/api/scheduling/availability-rules/route.ts` | Redundant implementation with fewer features |
| `/api/scheduling/availability/time-slots/route.ts` | `/api/scheduling/time-slots/route.ts` | Redundant implementation with inconsistent path pattern |
| `/api/scheduling/profiles/builder/[id]/route.ts` | `/api/profiles/builder/route.ts` | Redundant implementation under inconsistent path |
| `/api/scheduling/profiles/client/[id]/route.ts` | `/api/profiles/user/route.ts` | Redundant implementation under inconsistent path |

### 3. Legacy Migrated Routes

These routes were part of the authentication migration and are no longer needed:

| Route | Reason for Removal |
|-------|-------------------|
| `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` | Legacy NextAuth routes, functionality migrated to Clerk |

### 4. Unused API Routes

These routes showed no references in client-side code or other API calls:

| Route | Reason for Removal |
|-------|-------------------|
| `/api/navigation/route.ts` | No client-side references found |
| `/api/admin/builders/prototype/route.ts` | No client-side references, development-only functionality |
| `/api/marketplace/filters/route.ts` | No client-side references, functionality available via builders route |

## Implementation Details

Each route was carefully analyzed before removal:
1. Search for client-side references using the search_code tool
2. Verify if functionality is duplicated in other routes
3. Check if the route was part of a deprecated feature or migration

## Alternative Routes

For each removed route with legitimate functionality, an alternative route is available:

| Removed Route | Alternative Route |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `/api/scheduling/availability/rules/route.ts` | `/api/scheduling/availability-rules/route.ts` |
| `/api/scheduling/availability/time-slots/route.ts` | `/api/scheduling/time-slots/route.ts` |
| `/api/scheduling/profiles/builder/[id]/route.ts` | `/api/profiles/builder/route.ts` (with query param) |
| `/api/scheduling/profiles/client/[id]/route.ts` | `/api/profiles/user/route.ts` (with query param) |
| `/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` | Clerk authentication API |
| `/api/navigation/route.ts` | No replacement needed (unused) |
| `/api/admin/builders/prototype/route.ts` | `/api/admin/builders/route.ts` or CLI script |
| `/api/marketplace/filters/route.ts` | Filter parameters on `/api/marketplace/builders/route.ts` |

## Considerations

1. **Progressive Cleanup**: Routes are removed in order of risk, starting with clear development/test routes.
2. **Monitoring**: After removal, routes are monitored for 404 errors to catch any missed references.
3. **Documentation**: Each route's functionality is documented here for historical reference.
4. **Standardization**: The cleanup prioritizes consistent naming patterns and RESTful design.
