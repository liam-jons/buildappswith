## Implementation Timeline

The estimated timeline for implementation is based on team capacity and priorities:

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Suggested Timeline |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-2 weeks | Weeks 1-2 |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 weeks | Weeks 2-5 |
| Phase 3 | 1-2 weeks | Weeks 4-6 |
| Phase 4 | 1-2 weeks | Weeks 6-8 |
| Phase 5 | 1-2 weeks | Weeks 7-9 |
| Phase 6 | 1 week | Week 9-10 |

Total estimated timeline: 9-10 weeks

## Dependencies and Risks

### External Dependencies

1. **API Endpoints** - Requires stable marketplace API endpoints
2. **Design System** - UI components depend on the core design system
3. **Authentication** - User authentication for personalized marketplace views
4. **Analytics** - Tracking integration for marketplace events

### Potential Risks

1. **Data Schema Changes** - Changes to the underlying data model may require component updates
2. **Route Changes** - URL structure changes could affect navigation
3. **Performance Impact** - Large datasets may affect rendering performance
4. **Browser Compatibility** - Ensuring consistent experience across browsers

## Success Metrics

The success of the implementation will be measured by:

1. **Zero Circular Dependencies** - Elimination of all circular imports
2. **Reduced Error Rate** - Measure decrease in recorded errors
3. **Improved Performance** - Page load time and interaction responsiveness
4. **Code Maintainability** - Reduction in code complexity metrics
5. **User Experience** - Improved marketplace usability metrics

## Rollout Strategy

To minimize disruption, we recommend a phased rollout:

1. **Alpha Release** - Internal testing with the development team
2. **Beta Release** - Limited release to small percentage of users
3. **Staged Rollout** - Gradually increase percentage of users seeing new implementation
4. **Full Release** - Complete switchover to new implementation

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. **Feature Flag Toggle** - Ability to switch back to previous implementation
2. **Version-Specific Routes** - Maintain both implementations temporarily
3. **Monitored Deployment** - Real-time monitoring for immediate issue detection

## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap provides a structured approach to consolidating the marketplace components. By following this plan, we can systematically address the circular dependencies and create a more maintainable and robust marketplace experience.

The roadmap is designed to be adaptable, allowing for reprioritization based on evolving project needs while ensuring that high-priority items are addressed first to provide the maximum value as early as possible.
