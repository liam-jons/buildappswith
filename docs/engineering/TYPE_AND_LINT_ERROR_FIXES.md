# Type and Lint Error Fixes

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented to resolve TypeScript and ESLint errors that were blocking deployment.

## Date: May 7, 2025

## Critical Fixes

### Parsing Errors

Fixed syntax errors in the following files:

- `app/(platform)/profile/profile-settings/page.tsx`: Removed extraneous comma in UI components import
- `app/booking/confirmation/page.tsx`: Removed extra closing brace at file end
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`: Fixed import statement syntax error

### Auth Hooks Syntax Errors

Completely rewrote problematic sections of `hooks/auth/index.ts`:
- Replaced JSX syntax with React.createElement() in withClientAuth HOC
- Added React import
- Fixed syntax issues in component rendering
- Resolved reference errors in callback functions

### React/JSX Issues

Fixed unescaped entities in various components:
- `app/(platform)/learning/page.tsx`
- `components/landing/ai-capabilities-marquee.tsx`
- `components/landing/footer.tsx`
- `components/landing/hero-section.tsx`
- `components/learning/timeline.tsx`

### Next.js Specific Warnings

1. Replaced HTML anchor tags with Next.js Link components:
   - `app/(platform)/profile/[id]/page.tsx`
   - `app/(platform)/book/[builderId]/page.tsx`

2. Replaced standard img tags with Next.js Image components:
   - `components/magicui/avatar-circles.tsx`
   - `app/(platform)/book/[builderId]/page.tsx`

3. Added display name to memo components in:
   - `components/landing/performance-optimizations.tsx`

## Remaining Issues

While critical blocking issues have been resolved, there are still some warnings and non-blocking errors:

1. React Hook dependency warnings in:
   - `components/auth/protected-route.tsx`
   - `components/magicui/particles.tsx`
   - `components/scheduling/calendly/calendly-embed.tsx`

2. Next.js Image component warnings in multiple landing page components

3. Type errors in booking and builder profile interfaces

## Next Steps

For complete compliance, the following should be addressed in future updates:

1. Convert all remaining `<img>` tags to Next.js `<Image>` components
2. Fix remaining React hook dependency warnings using useCallback or dependency inclusion
3. Update builder profile and booking types for proper TypeScript compatibility
4. Escape all remaining entity characters in JSX strings

These remaining issues are not blocking deployment but should be scheduled for the next maintenance cycle.
