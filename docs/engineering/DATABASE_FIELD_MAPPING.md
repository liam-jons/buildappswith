# Database Field Mapping Solution

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a field mapping solution to handle discrepancies between the database schema and application code, specifically addressing the `image` vs `imageUrl` issue in the User model.

## Problem Statement

The application experienced an infinite loop and `PrismaClientValidationError` when accessing the Marketplace page due to mismatches between field names in the codebase (`imageUrl`) and the actual database schema (`image`).

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Field Mapper Utility

We implemented a field mapper utility (`user-mapper.ts`) that provides compatibility between database schema fields and application code expectations:

```typescript
// Field mapper function for User records
export function mapUserFields<T extends Record<string, any>>(user: T): T & { imageUrl?: string } {
  if (!user) return user;
  
  try {
    // Create a shallow copy of the user object
    const mappedUser = { ...user };
    
    // Handle image/imageUrl field
    if ('image' in user && !('imageUrl' in user)) {
      // Map image to imageUrl for backward compatibility
      mappedUser.imageUrl = user.image;
    }
    
    return mappedUser;
  } catch (error) {
    // Error logging and fallback to original user object
    return user;
  }
}
```

### 2. Service Layer Integration

The mapper is applied in the service layer (`marketplace-service.ts`) to ensure consistent field access:

```typescript
// Example usage in service layer
const mappedUser = mapUserFields(builder.user);

// Use the mapped fields
return {
  // ...
  avatarUrl: mappedUser.imageUrl || undefined,
  // ...
};
```

### 3. Error Handling

We implemented comprehensive error handling to ensure the application remains resilient:

- Try/catch blocks around mapping operations with detailed logging
- Fallback mechanisms to prevent page crashes when data is improperly formatted
- Client-side validation of image URLs to prevent rendering errors

### 4. Diagnostic Tools

Diagnostic scripts were created to assist in troubleshooting:

- `diagnose-image-field.js`: Verifies database structure and validates field presence
- `test-field-mapper.js`: Tests the mapping utility with various scenarios

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Insights

After examining the database schema, we confirmed:

1. The User model has an `image` field with data type `text` (appropriate for storing URL strings)
2. The `image` field is nullable (`is_nullable: YES`)
3. No `imageUrl` field exists in the database schema

### Field Mapping Strategy

The solution uses a non-intrusive adapter pattern that:

1. Preserves original field data
2. Adds compatibility fields only when needed
3. Maintains type safety with TypeScript
4. Provides fallback mechanisms

### Error Handling Strategies

1. **Service Layer**: Try/catch blocks with detailed logging
2. **API Routes**: Enhanced error responses with debugging information in development
3. **UI Components**: Graceful degradation when image data is missing or invalid

### Performance Considerations

- The mapping involves shallow object copying, minimizing memory overhead
- Mapping is performed only when retrieving data, not during writes
- Selective field mapping to avoid unnecessary transformations

## Future Improvements

1. **Schema Alignment**: Consider aligning the database schema with code expectations in a future migration
2. **Global Middleware**: Implement a global response transformer for consistent field mapping
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for mapping errors to detect potential issues

## Usage Guidelines

When working with User data that includes profile images:

1. Always use the `mapUserFields` utility before accessing image-related fields
2. Access image URL via the `imageUrl` field after mapping is applied
3. Include proper error handling for cases where mapping might fail
