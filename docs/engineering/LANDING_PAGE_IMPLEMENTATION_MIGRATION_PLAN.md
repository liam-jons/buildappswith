  4. Testing Strategy (to be agreed in a future chat session)


  5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

  Potential Risks

  1. Content Mismatch
    - Risk: New components may not support all content from the original implementation
    - Mitigation: Carefully audit current content and ensure all is transferred; adapt components as needed
  2. Performance Regression
    - Risk: New components might be more JavaScript-heavy and affect performance
    - Mitigation: Monitor Core Web Vitals before and after; optimize animations and code splitting
  3. NavLink Compatibility
    - Risk: The new header's navigation might work differently from the current implementation
    - Mitigation: Test and adapt the navigation logic to ensure smooth scrolling works the same
  4. Cross-Browser Issues
    - Risk: New components might have different behavior across browsers
    - Mitigation: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge; fix any inconsistencies
