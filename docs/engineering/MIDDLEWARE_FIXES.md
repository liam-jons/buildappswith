# Middleware Error Handling and Static Asset Protection

## Issue Description
Our application experienced middleware-related errors causing sporadic failures in development and production, particularly when handling static assets and authentication redirects. These errors resulted in unnecessary redirects of static assets to login pages and unhandled exceptions in the middleware chain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Static Asset Protection
- Expanded the `ignoredRoutes` array in auth middleware to be more comprehensive
- Added specific patterns for Next.js static assets (`/_next/image(.*)`)
- Added explicit paths for image directories (`/images/(.*)`, `/logos/(.*)`, `/assets/(.*)`)
- Added specific static image files at root level (`/hero-light.png`, `/hero-dark.png`, `/favicon.ico`)
- Added placeholder for future Sanity integration paths

### 2. Robust Error Handling
- Implemented defensive programming with try/catch blocks around critical middleware functions
- Added more detailed error logging with path context for troubleshooting
- Added specific error handling for redirect operations and header manipulations
- Added error boundaries for different middleware operations to prevent cascading failures

### 3. Static Asset Protection Logic
- Added detection for asset requests using file extension regex
- Prevents unnecessary authentication redirects for static assets like images and CSS
- Improves performance by skipping complex redirects for non-page requests

## Technical Details
- File modified: `middleware.ts`
- Implementation approach: Progressive enhancement without breaking changes
- Testing: Verified in development that static assets load correctly without authentication errors

## Impact
These changes significantly improve application stability by:
1. Preventing unnecessary redirects of static resources
2. Properly handling errors without crashing the middleware chain
3. Adding defensive code to prevent common edge cases from causing failures
4. Improving logging for better observability when issues occur
