All API routes have been successfully migrated from NextAuth.js to Clerk authentication:

1. `/app/api/scheduling/bookings/[id]/route.ts`
2. `/app/api/scheduling/session-types/route.ts`
3. `/app/api/scheduling/session-types/[id]/route.ts`
4. `/app/api/checkout/session/route.ts`
5. `/app/api/apps/[builderId]/route.ts`
6. `/app/api/apps/edit/[id]/route.ts`
7. `/app/api/scheduling/availability/rules/route.ts`
8. `/app/api/scheduling/profiles/client/[id]/route.ts`
9. `/app/api/admin/builders/prototype/route.ts`
10. `/app/api/admin/session-types/route.ts`
11. `/app/api/admin/session-types/[id]/status/route.ts`
12. `/app/api/admin/session-types/[id]/route.ts`

### Client Component Migrations (v1.0.62-1.0.63)

1. ✅ Created compatibility layer in v1.0.62
   - Added `/lib/auth/clerk-hooks.ts` with Clerk-based implementation of `useAuth()` and `useHasRole()`
   - Updated `/lib/auth/hooks.ts` to re-export the new Clerk hooks

2. ✅ Migrated key components in v1.0.63
   - `/components/auth/auth-provider.tsx` - Replaced NextAuth's SessionProvider with Clerk's ClerkProvider
   - `/components/user-auth-form.tsx` - Updated to use Clerk's authentication methods directly
   - `/components/site-header.tsx` - Modified to use Clerk's hooks directly

3. ✅ Archived legacy NextAuth files
   - Moved original files to `/archived/nextauth-legacy/` directory for reference
   - Added placeholder files with comments at original locations

4. ✅ Updated dependencies
   - Removed `next-auth` dependency
   - Removed `@auth/prisma-adapter` dependency

## Final Verification Checklist

- [x] All API routes use Clerk authentication
- [x] Client components migrated to use Clerk directly
- [x] Legacy files archived with placeholders
- [x] Dependencies updated to remove NextAuth packages
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of authentication flows
- [ ] Final documentation updates

## Migration Completed

✅ All migration tasks have been completed as of version 1.0.65:

1. **API Route Migration**
   - Migrated all API routes to use Clerk authentication
   - Updated authentication checks in protected routes
   - Implemented proper role validation
   - Added fallback handlers for legacy NextAuth routes

2. **Client Component Migration**
   - Migrated client components to use Clerk directly
   - Created compatibility layer for smooth transition
   - Updated all authentication components

3. **Database Migration**
   - Added `clerkId` field to User model
   - Implemented webhook handler for Clerk user events
   - Created robust database reset scripts
   - Bypassed migration conflicts with direct schema creation

4. **Webhook Implementation**
   - Created webhook handler for `user.created` and `user.updated` events
   - Implemented proper database synchronization
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Used dynamic imports for reliable dependency loading

5. **CSP Updates**
   - Updated Content Security Policy headers for Clerk
   - Allowed necessary Clerk domains for authentication
   - Enhanced middleware with security improvements
   
6. **Supporting Infrastructure**
   - Implemented structured logging system
   - Created installation script for Clerk dependencies
   - Added graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
   - Enhanced build process compatibility

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Verify sign-in flows with different providers (email, GitHub)
   - Test sign-out functionality
   - Validate role-based protections across different user types
   - Ensure error handling works correctly in edge cases

2. **Documentation Finalization**
   - Update any remaining documentation that references NextAuth
   - Create architectural diagrams showing new authentication flow
   - Document Clerk usage patterns for new developers

3. **Future Cleanup**
   - Remove placeholder files in a future release
   - Consider full removal of archived files once stability is confirmed

## Notes for Developers

1. **Using Authentication in Components**
   - Import authentication hooks directly from Clerk: `import { useAuth, useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";`
   - For role-based access, use the roles stored in Clerk's user metadata

2. **Accessing User Data in API Routes**
   - Use the `currentUser()` function from Clerk to get user information
   - Access roles via the `user.publicMetadata.roles` property

3. **Testing Authentication Locally**
   - Ensure Clerk development keys are set in your `.env.local` file
   - Create test users with appropriate roles in the Clerk dashboard
