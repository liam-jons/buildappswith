## Component Migration

While all API routes have been migrated, client-side components still need attention:

### Implemented Compatibility Layer

We've created a compatibility layer that allows components using the old NextAuth hooks to continue working with Clerk:

- Created `/lib/auth/clerk-hooks.ts` with Clerk-based implementation of `useAuth()` and `useHasRole()`
- Updated `/lib/auth/hooks.ts` to re-export the new Clerk hooks
- This allows components to continue using imports from `@/lib/auth/hooks` without changes

### Components to Review

The following components should be reviewed and updated to use Clerk hooks directly:

1. `/components/site-header.tsx` - Using compatibility layer currently
2. Any component using `useSession()` directly from NextAuth
3. Any component using the NextAuth `signIn()` or `signOut()` functions
4. Profile-related components that may depend on session data

### Component Migration Process

1. Identify components using NextAuth hooks
2. Update imports from `next-auth/react` to `@clerk/nextjs`
3. Update hook usage to match Clerk's API
4. Test component functionality after migration

# Remaining Authentication Migration Tasks

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the migration from NextAuth.js to Clerk authentication.

**Current Version: 1.0.62**  
**Last Updated: April 24, 2025**

## Completed Migrations

All API routes have been successfully migrated from NextAuth.js to Clerk authentication:

### Version 1.0.60 Migrations
1. `/app/api/scheduling/bookings/[id]/route.ts`
2. `/app/api/scheduling/session-types/route.ts`
3. `/app/api/scheduling/session-types/[id]/route.ts`
4. `/app/api/checkout/session/route.ts`
5. `/app/api/apps/[builderId]/route.ts`
6. `/app/api/apps/edit/[id]/route.ts`

### Version 1.0.61 Migrations
1. `/app/api/scheduling/availability/rules/route.ts`
2. `/app/api/scheduling/profiles/client/[id]/route.ts`
3. `/app/api/admin/builders/prototype/route.ts`
4. `/app/api/admin/session-types/route.ts`
5. `/app/api/admin/session-types/[id]/status/route.ts`
6. `/app/api/admin/session-types/[id]/route.ts`


## Post-Migration Tasks

Now that all API routes have been migrated, the following tasks remain to complete the authentication migration:

1. **Remove Legacy Files**
   - `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth API handler
   - `/lib/auth/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration and handlers
   - `/lib/auth/auth-config.ts` - NextAuth config options
   - `/lib/auth-utils.ts` - Legacy auth utilities
   - `/lib/contexts/auth/auth-provider.tsx` - Legacy auth context provider

2. **Update Dependencies**
   - Remove `next-auth` dependency
   - Remove `@auth/prisma-adapter` dependency
   - Update the Clerk dependencies to their latest versions

3. **Final Testing**
   - Verify all authentication flows work as expected
   - Test role-based protections function correctly
   - Ensure error handling and reporting is comprehensive

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation to reflect new authentication flow
   - Add comprehensive tests for authentication flows
   - Review and update any remaining references to NextAuth

## Final Verification Checklist

- [ ] All API routes use Clerk authentication
- [ ] No references to NextAuth remain in the codebase
- [ ] Authentication flows work as expected
- [ ] Role-based protections function correctly
- [ ] Error handling and reporting is comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is updated for developers and users
- [ ] Performance is equal or better than before migration
