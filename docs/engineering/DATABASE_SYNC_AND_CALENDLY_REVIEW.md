Session Summary: Database Sync and Calendly Integration

  Database Sync Challenges and Solutions

  1. Initial Script Creation
    - Created a database backup and sync script using pg_dump
    - Challenge: PostgreSQL version mismatch between local client (14.17) and server (17.4)
    - Solution: Developed an alternative script using Prisma directly to bypass pg_dump
  2. Schema Definition Issues
    - Challenge: Error with User.image column - column existed in schema but not in database
    - Solution: Created schema inspection script to determine actual column names and created targeted script for profile sync
  3. Foreign Key Constraints
    - Challenge: Builder profiles couldn't be created because users didn't exist
    - Solution: Modified sync approach to copy users first, then builder profiles, maintaining referential integrity
  4. Clerk ID Synchronization
    - Challenge: Clerk ID in production database didn't match the actual ID from Clerk dashboard
    - Solution: Created dedicated script to update just Liam's profile with correct Clerk ID
  5. Missing Session Types
    - Challenge: No session types existed in production for the booking flow
    - Solution: Created script to copy and create sample session types in production

  Build Issues and Solutions

  1. Authentication Error Module Issue
    - Challenge: Missing export for AuthenticationError causing TypeScript build failure
    - Solution: Fixed export in lib/auth/express/index.ts to properly export the error class from errors.ts

  Scripts Created

  1. backup-and-sync-database.js - Initial script using pg_dump (failed due to version mismatch)
  2. prisma-backup-and-sync.js - Second attempt using Prisma (failed due to schema issues)
  3. prisma-builder-sync.js - Targeted approach for syncing builders (failed due to FK constraints)
  4. check-profile-status.js - Diagnostic script to examine profile state in both databases
  5. update-liam-clerk-id-fixed.js - Script that successfully updated Liam's profile with correct Clerk ID
  6. check-session-types.js - Script to check and create session types

  Current Status

  - Successfully updated Liam's profile in production with correct Clerk ID and email
  - Created session types in production
  - Fixed build errors related to authentication exports
  - Key Issue Identified: Even though database sync succeeded, builders still aren't appearing in the marketplace UI
