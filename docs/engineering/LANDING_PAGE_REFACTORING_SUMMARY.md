# Landing Page & Marketing Setup Refactoring Summary

**Note (May 14, 2025):** Some of the changes documented below have been reversed as part of our header unification effort. Specifically, the separation of SiteHeader and MarketingHeader has been reverted to use a unified SiteHeader component across all pages. See [Header Unification Decision](../../docs/architecture/decisions/header-unification-2025-05-14.md) for details.

This document summarizes the refactoring done to improve the organization and structure of the landing page and marketing components.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Component Export Fixes

- Updated exports in `marketing-header.tsx` and `marketing-footer.tsx`:
  - Changed function names from `SiteHeader` to `MarketingHeader` and `SiteFooter` to `MarketingFooter`
  - Added proper default exports for both components

### 2. Marketing Layout Updates

- Updated marketing layout (`app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`) to use domain-specific components:
  - Now imports `MarketingHeader` and `MarketingFooter` from the marketing domain
  - Maintains the same layout structure and functionality

### 3. Barrel Export Standardization

- Fixed marketing barrel exports in `components/marketing/index.ts`:
  - Removed duplicate exports and improved organization
  - Ensured consistent export patterns across components
  - Maintained proper re-exporting of subdirectories

- Fixed UI barrel exports in `components/marketing/ui/index.ts`:
  - Removed duplicate exports
  - Standardized export format for UI components

- Fixed landing domain barrel exports:
  - Updated landing components to use PascalCase for consistency
  - Standardized barrel exports in landing domain
  - Added proper default exports for components missing them

### 4. Domain Organization Improvements

- Created domain organization documentation:
  - Added clear separation between marketing and landing domains
  - Documented component responsibilities and boundaries
  - Provided guidance on which domain to use for different purposes

### 5. Metadata Enhancement

- Enhanced metadata for marketing pages in `app/(marketing)/metadata.ts`:
  - Added title templates for consistent page titles
  - Expanded keywords for better SEO
  - Added structured Twitter card data
  - Included additional SEO metadata like canonical URLs and robots directives
  - Added theme color and viewport configurations
  
- Created metadata documentation with usage guidelines

## Results

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Improved Component Organization:** Clear separation between marketing and landing components
2. **Consistent Naming Convention:** All components now follow PascalCase naming
3. **Standardized Exports:** Barrel exports follow a consistent pattern
4. **Enhanced SEO:** Improved metadata for better search engine visibility
5. **Better Documentation:** Added documentation for domain organization and metadata usage

## Future Considerations

1. Consider consolidating components that serve similar purposes across domains
2. Review any remaining export patterns in other domains for consistency
3. Implement the enhanced metadata across other page groups
4. Consider using TypeScript interfaces to enforce metadata structure
