# Combined Fix: Marketplace Routes, UI Imports, and Calendly Integration

This document describes the combined fixes for several issues that were causing build errors and rendering problems in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Marketplace Routing Conflict**: 
   - Conflict between the main marketplace page and dynamic builder profiles
   - Fixed by restructuring routes to use `/marketplace/builders/[id]`

2. **UI Component Import Paths**:
   - Incorrect imports from `@/components/ui/component` instead of `@/components/ui/core/component`
   - Fixed by updating import paths in all components

3. **Calendar Component Missing**:
   - References to a non-existent Calendar component
   - Fixed by replacing with the Calendly integration

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Marketplace Routing Fix

- Moved builder profiles from `/marketplace/[id]` to `/marketplace/builders/[id]`
- Updated links in components to use the new URL structure
- Created routing documentation for future reference

### 2. UI Component Import Paths Fix

- Updated import paths in scheduling components
- Created a script to automatically fix import paths
- Added documentation for proper import patterns

### 3. Calendly Integration

- Replaced custom booking calendar with Calendly integration
- Updated booking page to use CalendlyEmbed component
- Created documentation for using Calendly integration

## Scripts Created

1. **`fix-ui-core-imports.js`**:
   - Automatically finds and fixes incorrect import paths
   - Updates import statements to use the core directory

2. **`switch-to-calendly.sh`**:
   - Switches from custom booking calendar to Calendly integration
   - Updates relevant imports and component usage

3. **`fix-imports-and-restart.sh`**:
   - Runs import fixes
   - Cleans cache
   - Restarts development server

4. **`restart-after-routing-fix.sh`**:
   - Helper script for testing routing changes

## Documentation Added

1. **`MARKETPLACE_ROUTING_FIX.md`**:
   - Details of the routing conflict and solution
   - Best practices for Next.js routing

2. **`IMPORT_PATH_FIX.md`**:
   - Explanation of UI component import issue
   - Guidelines for consistent imports

3. **`CALENDLY_MIGRATION.md`**:
   - Migration from custom calendar to Calendly
   - Usage instructions for Calendly integration

## Testing the Fixes

1. Run the combined fix script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/fix-imports-and-restart.sh
   ```

2. After restarting, clear browser cache and localStorage

3. Test the following routes:
   - Main marketplace: http://localhost:3000/marketplace
   - Builder profile: http://localhost:3000/marketplace/builders/{builder-id}
   - Booking page: http://localhost:3000/book/{builder-id}

## Future Recommendations

1. **Import Consistency**:
   - Consider implementing a barrel export system for UI components
   - Add ESLint rules to enforce consistent imports

2. **Route Structure**:
   - Follow RESTful-like URL patterns
   - Add more specific route segments to avoid conflicts

3. **Third-Party Integrations**:
   - Continue using Calendly for scheduling needs
   - Document integration points clearly
