# Sentry Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document provides information about the Sentry Error Monitoring and Performance Tracking implementation in the BuildAppsWith platform. It includes details about the architecture, implementation choices, and recommendations for future improvements.

## Implementation Architecture

The Sentry integration is structured into several components:

1. **Core Configuration** (`lib/sentry/config.ts`)
   - Centralized configuration for all Sentry instances
   - Environment-aware settings (dev, test, staging, production)

2. **Error Classification** (`lib/sentry/error-classification.ts`)
   - Structured error taxonomy with severity, category, and impact levels
   - Rich error metadata for better debugging and prioritization

3. **Sensitive Data Filtering** (`lib/sentry/sensitive-data-filter.ts`)
   - PII and sensitive data redaction
   - Cookie, header, and query parameter filtering

4. **Performance Monitoring** (`lib/sentry/performance.ts`)
   - Transaction and span tracking
   - Web vitals and performance profiling
   - Defensive implementation that works in all environments

5. **User Context** (`lib/sentry/user-context.ts`)
   - User identification and session tracking
   - Context enrichment for better error attribution
   - Environment-aware implementation (client vs server)

6. **Enhanced Logger** (`lib/enhanced-logger.ts`)
   - Structured logging with Sentry integration
   - Log level to Sentry severity mapping
   - Environment-aware logging configuration

## Initialization Files

- `sentry.client.config.ts` - Client-side initialization
- `sentry.server.config.ts` - Server-side initialization
- `sentry.edge.config.ts` - Edge runtime initialization

## Current Implementation Challenges

The current implementation addresses several challenges:

1. **API Compatibility**
   - Different Sentry APIs available in different environments (client, server, edge)
   - Defensive coding to handle missing APIs gracefully

2. **Environment Differences**
   - Next.js App Router with hybrid rendering
   - Client components vs Server components vs Edge middleware

3. **Security Concerns**
   - PII and sensitive data filtering
   - Proper error classification and exposure control

## Implementation Notes

During implementation, several adjustments were made to ensure compatibility across environments:

1. **API Abstraction**
   - Removed direct dependency on specific Sentry APIs like `Severity`, `BrowserTracing`, and `Replay`
   - Used local constants and mappings instead of importing potentially unavailable enums
   - Decoupled implementation from specific Sentry exports

2. **Defensive API Usage**
   - Added type and existence checks before calling any Sentry functions
   - Implemented complete fallbacks for when Sentry APIs aren't available
   - Wrapped all API calls in try/catch blocks with silent error handling
   - Used TypeScript interfaces to ensure consistent implementation regardless of API availability

3. **Server Component Compatibility**
   - Made all components client-safe without server-only APIs
   - Created custom cookie parsing for request objects
   - Added environment checks to prevent server code from running on the client
   - Avoided any import from next/headers or other server-only modules

4. **Resilient Transaction Tracking**
   - Implemented independent transaction and span tracking that doesn't rely on Sentry APIs
   - Used Web Performance API as a fallback for browser environments
   - Created complete mock implementations that maintain the expected interfaces
   - Made performance monitoring environment-aware with separate client and server paths

## Future Improvements

1. **Next.js Instrumentation Migration**
   - Migrate from `sentry.*.config.ts` to the newer instrumentation API
   - Use `instrumentation.ts` and `instrumentation-client.ts` for cleaner integration

2. **Enhanced Error Boundaries**
   - Implement domain-specific error boundaries
   - Better error recovery and fallback UI

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - More comprehensive unit tests for error handling
   - Integration tests for error reporting flows
   - Mock Sentry for testing Sentry integration

4. **Monitoring Dashboards**
   - Create custom Sentry dashboards for key metrics
   - Set up alerts for critical errors and performance degradation

5. **Documentation**
   - Further document error classification guidelines
   - Create developer guides for proper error handling

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Error Classification**
   - Use appropriate error severity and category
   - Include relevant context in error metadata
   - Consider user impact when classifying errors

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Use transactions for high-level operations
   - Create spans for nested operations
   - Add meaningful tags and data to transactions

3. **User Context**
   - Use the appropriate context enrichment function
   - Include relevant user information for better error attribution
   - Be mindful of PII in error reports

## Implementation Verification

The implementation has been verified to work in development environments. Ensure to test in staging and production with real monitoring enabled.
