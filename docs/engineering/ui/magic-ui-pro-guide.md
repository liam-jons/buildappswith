# The Ultimate Guide to Magic UI Pro: Components, Integration & Domain-Driven Organization

Magic UI Pro is a premium React component library offering 50+ beautifully crafted blocks and templates that can save developers thousands of hours when creating stunning landing pages. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, it delivers visually appealing, interactive elements that bridge the gap between design and development.

## What is Magic UI Pro?

Magic UI Pro extends the free Magic UI library (which offers 150+ animated components) with premium templates specifically designed for creating marketing sites and landing pages. The Pro version follows a similar installation pattern to shadcn/ui, where components are added directly to your project rather than imported from a package. This means you own the components once they're added, allowing complete customization to match your branding and design requirements.

As of 2025, Magic UI Pro fully supports React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4, making it compatible with the latest web development standards. The library is designed to save development time, with claims of saving up to $19,951 compared to building from scratch and launching projects up to 17.5 business days sooner.

## Domain-Driven Integration with Next.js

Magic UI Pro components can be effectively organized within a domain-driven architecture for Next.js applications. This approach organizes code by business domain rather than technical function, creating more maintainable and business-aligned applications.

### Domain-Driven Folder Structure

Here's a recommended folder structure for integrating Magic UI Pro in a domain-driven Next.js application:

```
src/
  domains/                    # Domain logic and UI
    auth/
      application/            # Auth use cases
      domain/                 # Auth domain models
      infrastructure/         # Auth API services
      ui/                     # Auth-specific components
        components/
          LoginForm/          # Components using Magic UI Pro
          
    products/
      application/
      domain/
      infrastructure/
      ui/
        components/
          ProductCard/        # Components using Magic UI Pro
          
  shared/                     # Shared code
    ui/                       # Shared UI components
      components/             # Base Magic UI components
        Button/
        Card/
        Modal/
      layouts/                # Layout components
      theme/                  # Theme utilities
    utils/                    # Utility functions
    hooks/                    # Shared hooks
      
  app/                        # Next.js app directory
    (domains)/                # Group for all domain routes
      (auth)/                 # Auth domain routes
      (shop)/                 # Shop domain routes
    layout.tsx                # Root layout
    page.tsx                  # Homepage
```

### Component Organization Principles

1. **Base Components in Shared Layer**: Place Magic UI Pro's basic components in a shared UI layer that can be imported by any domain.

2. **Domain-Specific Wrappers**: Create domain-specific component wrappers around base Magic UI components:

```tsx
// src/domains/checkout/ui/components/CheckoutButton/CheckoutButton.tsx
import { Button } from '@/shared/ui/components/Button';

export function CheckoutButton({ onCheckout, isDisabled }) {
  return (
    <Button 
      onClick={onCheckout} 
      disabled={isDisabled}
      variant="primary"
      size="lg"
    >
      Complete Checkout
    </Button>
  );
}
```

3. **Compound Component Pattern**: For complex UI elements:

```tsx
// src/shared/ui/components/Card/Card.tsx
import { Card as MagicCard } from './MagicCard';

function Card({ children }) {
  return <MagicCard>{children}</MagicCard>;
}

Card.Header = function CardHeader({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-header">{children}</div>;
};

Card.Body = function CardBody({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-body">{children}</div>;
};

Card.Footer = function CardFooter({ children }) {
  return <div className="card-footer">{children}</div>;
};

export { Card };
```

4. **Container/Presenter Pattern**: Separate logic and presentation:

```tsx
// Container component with logic
export function CartItemContainer({ item }) {
  const { quantity, incrementQuantity, decrementQuantity, removeItem } = 
    useCartItemActions(item.id);

  return (
    <CartItemPresenter
      item={item}
      quantity={quantity}
      onIncrement={incrementQuantity}
      onDecrement={decrementQuantity}
      onRemove={removeItem}
    />
  );
}

// Presenter component with Magic UI Pro components
export function CartItemPresenter({ item, quantity, onIncrement, onDecrement, onRemove }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      {/* UI using Magic UI Pro components */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Next.js App Router Integration

With Next.js App Router, you can structure your domains within the app directory:

```
app/
  (domains)/                # Group for all domain routes
    (authentication)/       # Auth domain routes
      login/
        page.tsx
      register/
        page.tsx
    (shop)/                 # Shop domain routes
      products/
        page.tsx
        [id]/
        page.tsx
  _domains/                 # Domain logic (not routes)
  _shared/                  # Shared code and components
```

Using route groups (parentheses) and private folders (underscore prefix) helps organize the application while maintaining the correct routing structure.

## Best Practices for Implementation

### 1. Component Usage Patterns

- **Use in Server Components**: Magic UI Pro components work in both client and server components (added 'use client' at build time)
- **Always import from individual packages**: Import components directly from their specific paths:
  ```tsx
  // Correct
  import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
  
  // Incorrect
  import { Button } from "@heroui/react";
  ```
- **Library first, Templates second**: Start by integrating base components, then incorporate templates for specific sections

### 2. Domain Logic Separation

- Place all domain logic in the application layer, keeping UI components focused solely on presentation:
  ```tsx
  // domains/cart/application/useCartItem.ts
  export function useCartItem(itemId) {
    const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1);
    
    const increment = () => {
      // Domain logic for incrementing quantity
      setQuantity(prev => prev + 1);
    };
    
    return { quantity, increment, /* other methods */ };
  }
  ```

### 3. Adapters for External Services

Use adapters to isolate external dependencies from your domain:

```tsx
// domains/products/infrastructure/productApiAdapter.ts
export async function fetchProducts() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/products');
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Transform API data to domain model
  return data.map(item => ({
    id: item.id,
    name: item.name,
    // ...other transformations
  }));
}
```

### 4. Domain Models for Business Logic

Define domain models to encapsulate business rules:

```tsx
// domains/products/domain/Product.ts
export class Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  
  constructor(data) {
    this.id = data.id;
    this.name = data.name;
    this.price = data.price;
  }
  
  isInStock() {
    return this.inventory > 0;
  }
  
  formattedPrice() {
    return `$${this.price.toFixed(2)}`;
  }
}
```

## Customization Options

Magic UI Pro offers extensive customization capabilities:

1. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Leverage Tailwind's utility classes for styling without writing custom CSS:
   ```tsx
   <Button className="bg-brand-500 hover:bg-brand-600">
     Custom Styled Button
   </Button>
   ```

2. **Component Properties**: Components accept standard props for behavior modifications:
   ```tsx
   <AnimatedList delay={0.1} staggerDelay={0.05}>
     {items.map(item => <ListItem key={item.id} {...item} />)}
   </AnimatedList>
   ```

3. **Theme Customization**: Modify color schemes through Tailwind's configuration:
   ```js
   // tailwind.config.js
   module.exports = {
     theme: {
       extend: {
         colors: {
           brand: {
             50: '#f0f9ff',
             // other shades
             900: '#0c4a6e',
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Animation Parameters**: Many components offer animation customization:
   ```tsx
   <TextReveal
     text="Your amazing headline"
     duration={0.8}
     delay={0.2}
     ease="easeInOut"
   />
   ```
