# Clerk Authentication Status

## Overview

This document provides the current status of the Clerk authentication implementation in the Buildappswith platform. It tracks completed tasks and any remaining items to ensure a consistent, robust authentication system.

**Current Version: 1.0.138**  
**Last Updated: April 28, 2025**

## Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks

#### API Route Migrations ✅
- All API routes migrated from NextAuth.js to Clerk authentication
- Implemented proper role validation using Clerk's user metadata
- Added fallback handlers for legacy NextAuth routes

#### Client Component Migrations ✅
- Migrated client components to use Clerk directly
- Created compatibility layer for smooth transition
- Updated all authentication components

#### Database Migration ✅
- Added `clerkId` field to User model
- Implemented webhook handler for Clerk user events
- Created robust database synchronization

#### Webhook Implementation ✅
- Created webhook handler for `user.created` and `user.updated` events
- Implemented proper database synchronization
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

#### CSP Updates ✅
- Updated Content Security Policy headers for Clerk
- Allowed necessary Clerk domains for authentication
- Enhanced middleware with security improvements

#### Authentication Code Cleanup ✅
- Updated `/lib/auth/index.ts` to directly export Clerk functionality
- Updated `/lib/auth/hooks.ts` to export custom hooks
- Enhanced warning in `/lib/auth/auth.ts` with clear removal timeline

#### Client-Side Hooks Implementation ✅
- Created `/lib/auth/clerk-hooks.ts` with custom hooks
- Implemented role-based hooks: `useHasRole`, `useIsAdmin`, `useIsBuilder`, `useIsClient`
- Added enhanced authentication hooks: `useAuth`, `useUser`, `useSignOut`, `useAuthStatus`
- Created comprehensive documentation in CLERK_HOOKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md

#### Test Utilities Update ✅
- Updated test utilities to use Clerk authentication
- Fixed test-utils.tsx and vitest-utils.tsx to use ClerkProvider
- Updated mock user data to match Clerk's format

## Key Components

### Authentication Hooks

The platform now provides a comprehensive set of authentication hooks:

1. **`useAuth()`** - Enhanced version of Clerk's useAuth with role-based helpers
2. **`useUser()`** - Transforms Clerk user data into application-specific format
3. **`useHasRole(role)`** - Checks if the user has a specific role
4. **`useIsAdmin()`**, **`useIsBuilder()`**, **`useIsClient()`** - Role-specific convenience hooks
5. **`useSignOut()`** - Wraps Clerk's sign-out functionality with improved options
6. **`useAuthStatus()`** - Simple hook for checking authentication status

### Server-Side Authentication

Server-side authentication uses these key components:

1. **`withAuth`**, **`withRole`**, **`withAdmin`**, **`withBuilder`** - Route protection wrappers
2. **`requireAuth()`**, **`requireRole()`** - Authentication enforcement functions
3. **`getCurrentUser()`** - Retrieves complete user profile from Clerk and database
4. **`hasRole()`** - Helper for checking specific roles

### Middleware Implementation

The middleware configuration provides:

1. **Route Protection** - Guards routes based on authentication status
2. **Role-Based Access** - Enforces role requirements for protected routes
3. **Security Headers** - Sets appropriate CSP and other security headers
4. **Redirection Logic** - Handles unauthorized access attempts gracefully
