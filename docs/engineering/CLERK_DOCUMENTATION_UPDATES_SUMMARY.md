## Documentation Structure

The authentication documentation now follows a logical structure:

1. **Current Implementation**
   - CLERK_AUTHENTICATION_STATUS.md (updated)
   - CLERK_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md (current state)
   - CLERK_HOOKS_IMPLEMENTATION.md (implementation details)
   - CLERK_TEST_UTILITIES.md (testing utilities)

2. **Implementation Understanding**
   - CLERK_AUTHENTICATION_FLOW.mermaid (visual architecture)
   - CLERK_AUTH_SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS.mermaid (flow sequences)
   - CLERK_MIDDLEWARE_CONFIG.md (middleware configuration)

3. **Testing & Validation**
