## Remaining Tasks

1. **Legacy Directory Removal**:
   - Remove `/app/(platform)/builder-dashboard` after unified dashboard verification
   - Remove `/app/(platform)/client-dashboard` after unified dashboard verification
   - Remove `/app/(platform)/builder-profile` after unified profile verification

This task is tracked in [BUI-80: Legacy Directory Removal Plan](https://linear.app/buildappswith/issue/BUI-80/legacy-directory-removal-plan).

## Implementation Approach

The folder structure reorganization has followed these principles:

1. **Complete Replacement**: Created new implementations rather than refactoring existing code
2. **Domain-First Organization**: Organized code by domain before technical type
3. **Consistent Structure**: Applied standard patterns across all domains
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed README.md files explaining purpose and structure

## Best Practices Established

The implementation has established these best practices:

1. **Barrel Exports**: All domains use index.ts files for simplified imports
2. **Component Hierarchy**: Clear separation between server and client components
3. **Domain Boundaries**: Clear separation between domains with well-defined integration points
4. **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive README.md files for all domains and major directories
5. **Import Patterns**: Consistent import patterns using barrel exports

## Domain Implementation Details

### UI Components

The UI domain is organized into:
- `/components/ui/core` - Foundational components like Button, Card, Input
- `/components/ui/composite` - Composed components like PageHeader, DataTable
- Both with proper barrel exports and comprehensive documentation

### Admin Components

The admin domain is organized into:
- `/components/admin` - Server components for administrative interfaces
- `/components/admin/ui` - Client components for interactive admin features
- Complete with actions, API routes, and comprehensive documentation

### Auth Components

The auth domain is organized into:
- `/components/auth` - Server components for authentication
- `/components/auth/ui` - Client components for authentication forms
- With Clerk integration and role-based access control

### Other Domains

All other domains follow the same consistent pattern:
- Server components at the root level
- Client components in the ui/ subdirectory
- Barrel exports for simplified imports
- Comprehensive documentation explaining the domain

## Cross-Domain Integration

The implementation includes clear documentation for cross-domain integration:
- How domains interact with each other
- How data flows between domains
- How to compose components from multiple domains
- Best practices for maintaining clear domain boundaries

## Component Composition Patterns

The implementation has established component composition patterns:
- Composing domain-specific components with shared UI components
- Building complex UIs from simpler components
- Using server components by default with client components only when needed
- Maintaining clear separation of concerns across components

## Conclusion

The folder structure reorganization is now complete, with all domains implemented according to the domain-first organization pattern and comprehensive documentation in place. The remaining task is the removal of legacy directories, which is tracked in a separate issue. The reorganization provides a solid foundation for the domain-driven architecture that will support the revenue-generating critical path identified in PRD 3.1.
