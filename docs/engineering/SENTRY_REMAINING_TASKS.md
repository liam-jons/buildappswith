# Sentry Integration: Remaining Tasks

*Version: 1.0.0*  
*Date: May 8, 2025*  
*Status: In Progress*

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining tasks needed to complete the Sentry implementation for the BuildAppsWith platform. The following tasks have been completed:

- ✅ Create comprehensive test scenarios for Sentry implementation
- ✅ Design Sentry dashboard configurations and alerting rules
- ✅ Define environment variable setup across development, staging, and production
- ✅ Create developer documentation for using the error handling system

The following tasks remain to be completed:

## 1. Establish CI/CD Pipeline Integration for Source Map Uploads

### Task Description
Set up automated source map generation and upload to Sentry during the CI/CD pipeline to ensure proper error stack trace resolution.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Source Map Generation Configuration**
   - Configure Next.js to properly generate source maps in production builds
   - Adjust webpack configuration for optimal source map generation
   - Verify source map files are correctly generated

2. **Sentry Release Integration**
   - Set up release creation in CI pipeline
   - Configure commit information to be included with releases
   - Implement version tagging system for releases

3. **Source Map Upload Automation**
   - Create automated script for source map collection and upload
   - Configure authentication for Sentry API in CI environment
   - Set up verification step to ensure successful upload

4. **Error Monitoring Verification**
   - Implement post-deployment verification of source map functionality
   - Create test error scenarios to validate stack trace resolution
   - Document source map debugging procedures

## 2. Update Integration Strategy Document Based on Implementation Learnings

### Task Description
Update the original `SENTRY_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md` document to reflect lessons learned during implementation and any adjustments to the original plan.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Implementation Review**
   - Conduct comprehensive review of implemented features
   - Compare original strategy with final implementation
   - Document any deviations or improvements

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - Analyze performance impact of Sentry integration
   - Document optimization strategies implemented
   - Provide recommendations for performance monitoring

3. **Security and Privacy Review**
   - Review PII filtering effectiveness
   - Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations
   - Document security considerations for future maintenance

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Update original strategy document with implementation insights
   - Add sections on lessons learned and best practices
   - Include recommendations for future enhancements

## 3. Create Roadmap for Future Sentry Integration Enhancements

### Task Description
Develop a strategic roadmap for future enhancements to the Sentry integration, prioritizing features that will provide the most value to the platform.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Feature Evaluation**
   - Evaluate potential enhancements to current implementation
   - Prioritize features based on business impact and implementation effort
   - Create feature cards for each potential enhancement

2. **Integration Optimization**
   - Identify areas for performance optimization
   - Research newer Sentry features that could be beneficial
   - Document integration with other monitoring systems

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Design improved error feedback mechanisms for users
   - Explore proactive error detection possibilities
   - Research predictive error prevention strategies

4. **Roadmap Documentation**
   - Create detailed roadmap document with timelines
   - Include implementation requirements for each feature
   - Document expected business impact of each enhancement

## Timeline and Priority

| Task | Priority | Estimated Effort | Suggested Timeline |
|------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| CI/CD Pipeline Integration | Medium | 3-5 days | 2 weeks |
| Update Integration Strategy | Low | 2-3 days | 1 month |
| Future Enhancement Roadmap | Low | 3-4 days | 1 month |

## Dependencies and Resources

- CI/CD pipeline access and configuration permissions
- Sentry API authentication tokens with appropriate permissions
- Documentation of current build and deployment processes
- Access to performance metrics for baseline comparison
