# Marketplace Component Fix

## Original Issues

The marketplace page was experiencing multiple issues:

1. **Routing Conflict**: The dynamic route `/marketplace/[id]` was incorrectly capturing all marketplace URLs
2. **Component Rendering Error**: The page was encountering a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error related to Select components and feature flags

## Two-Part Solution

### Part 1: Routing Fix
- Restructured routes to use `/marketplace/builders/[id]` instead of `/marketplace/[id]`
- Updated builder card links to use the new builder profile URL
- This fixed routing conflicts but the component rendering issues remained

### Part 2: Component Simplification
- Completely rebuilt the marketplace page from scratch
- Removed problematic components:
  - Removed feature flag implementation
  - Simplified state management
  - Removed Select component that was causing errors
  - Used simple divs for display instead of complex interactive components
  - Used direct event handlers instead of complex state-based handling

## Implementation Details

1. **Marketplace Page Rewrite**:
   - Created a simplified version that still shows all builders
   - Removed filter panel that used complex state management
   - Used direct onClick handlers instead of Link components
   - Used basic JSX elements instead of complex custom components
   - Added loading skeletons for better UX

2. **Direct DOM Manipulation**:
   - Used `window.location.href` for navigation instead of Next.js Link
   - This is normally not recommended, but helps isolate the issue

3. **Caching Fixes**:
   - Created a script to clear Next.js cache
   - Added instructions to clear browser localStorage
   - These steps help ensure the new implementation is fully loaded

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause appears to be a combination of:

1. **Select Component Issues**:
   - The radix-ui Select component was causing render loops
   - This may be due to state management or prop passing issues

2. **Feature Flag Integration**:
   - The feature flag implementation was interacting poorly with some components
   - This could be due to state synchronization issues or context re-renders

3. **Complex State Management**:
   - Multiple overlapping state variables with complex dependencies
   - Changes to one state variable might trigger cascading updates

## Future Recommendations

1. **Gradual Reintroduction**:
   - Start with this simplified page
   - Gradually reintroduce features one by one
   - Test thoroughly after each addition

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Create isolated tests for complex components
   - Test components individually before integration
   - Use React's dev tools to monitor re-renders

3. **State Management**:
   - Consider using a more predictable state management approach
   - Reduce dependencies between state variables
   - Use React Context or state management libraries for complex state

4. **Keep Feature Flags**:
   - The feature flag system is useful but needs refinement
   - Update to avoid render loops
   - Add better SSR handling

## Restoration Plan (If Needed)

If you need to restore the original marketplace page:
1. `cp "/Users/liamj/Documents/development/buildappswith/app/(platform)/marketplace/page.tsx.backup" "/Users/liamj/Documents/development/buildappswith/app/(platform)/marketplace/page.tsx"`

However, this will likely reintroduce the rendering issues.
